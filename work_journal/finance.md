- [Jack Bogle's investment advice][PersonalFinance] 
    - Regular re-balancing is not necessary 
    - 60-40 is probably good allocation 
    - key things to think about how much risk one can take 
    - pay attention to GDP
	- First, pare costs to the bone. Realize that in investing you get what you don’t pay for
	- Second, diversify. Own American business and hold on to it. Not one company or industry, but a broadly diversified portfolio of lots of companies and industries. Buy such a portfolio, never sell, and hold it forever. No one knows what stocks will do tomorrow, or even what they’ll do over the next decade, but over the long pull the dividends and earnings growth of American business will be reflected in rising stock prices
    - Third, don’t forget to allocate your assets prudently between stocks and bonds.
	- Fourth, don’t do something, just stand there. Stay the course.

    - Benjamin Graham believed that investors should never be entirely out of the stock market (or entirely in it, either).
    - Graham advised that when enthusiasm is high, you should trim back your stocks, but never to zero and when pessimism prevails, you should raise your allocation to stocks, but never to 100%.
    - Graham suggested keeping a minimum of 25% and a maximum of 75% in stocks, with the rest in bonds.

    - On virtues of Investors, 
        - Investors can cultivate their independence by working at it, by always asking whether what other people are saying or doing makes sense, by never pursuing a course of action just because other people are.
    - Norway Model vs Yale Model 
        - Norway has Social security program worth 1.3T for 5 million population 
        - It began after it discovered an abundance of oil back in 1969, and the country designed an investment strategy to grow their newfound wealth.
        - More than half of assets are in growth stocks alone. The Norway Pension Fund Global is the single  largest owner of global stocks in the entire world.
        - The Norway Model is characterized by minimal use of expensive products, like private equity and hedge funds, and focuses instead on keeping fees low, and diversifying across publicly traded stocks and bonds. It uses passive management – meaning the investment decision-makers don't purport to have the expertise to pick which stocks will outperform which other stocks. They just buy a little bit of every stock.
        -  Norway's pension fund currently has money in over 9,100 stocks, across 69 countries!
        - The other model is  Yale Model is characterized by usage of expensive alternative assets like hedge funds and private equity.
        - It is access to certain people, deals, and funds that make investing in expensive, private products potentially worth it. An institution like Yale has this access, and these connections, in spades. It is the institutions who don't have elite access, most of whom have, like lemmings, followed Yale into this investment approach, whose communities and alumni bases are being poorly served. Not everyone is Yale.

- [Financial Industry][PersonalFinance]
    - Reversion to mean -  yesterday’s best performing funds are tomorrow's worst performing funds.
    - selecting your fund for tomorrow by picking a winner from yesterday is an exercise fraught with peril.
    - Best-performing funds become worst and vice versa. But index funds continue to earn market returns. They are neither the best-performing nor the worst performing, they are squarely in the middle.
    - Nifty 50 Index fund charges 0.07%-0.20%, and active large-cap funds charge about 1-1.5%. So they have to generate 1-1.5% out-performance, just to cover the costs and then beat the index.

- [Criteria for Assets for Asset allocation plan][PersonalFinance], 
    - Fundamentally different - asset classes must be fundamentally different and have unique risk. Stocks and bonds are different; one is ownership and the other is loan. U.S. stocks are different from international stocks in base currency and government policy. Real estate and commodities differ from common stocks in collateral structure. In contrast, U.S. mid-cap stocks are not fundamentally different than large cap and there is very little unique risk.  
    - Real return – an asset class must generate a real return in the long-term (after-inflation). U.S. stocks have outperformed inflation by about six percent historically and real estate has earned about the same. Government bonds have outperformed by about two percent.  In contrast, commodities have no expected return over the inflation rate and do not pass this gate.

    - High liquidity – an asset class must have daily liquidity. Stocks that trade on an organized exchange, and bonds that trade over-the-counter on a regular basis, pass this gate. Real estate ownership − outright or in a partnership − would not pass this gate, although real estate investment trusts (REITs) are exchange traded and do pass. Coins, artwork and other collectables tend to be illiquid and do not qualify.

    - Diversified, low-cost funds – the asset class must be packaged in a liquid, low-cost and broadly diversified product such as a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). Since all the analysis on has been based on an index, I prefer to replicate that index in portfolios with index funds and ETFs. An actively-managed product can be used (absent of a good index product), as long as it is broadly diversified and low cost. 

- Prof. Richard Thaler's advice on investing 
    - Put away money to take care of emergency (typically government bonds)
    - Use low-cost index funds as core holdings. Plan on investing for decades.
    - Decide on Asset allocation

- Investing#Index fund
    - TRI - Total returns index - Nifty index values are ignoring dividends but TRI shows figure dividends/bonuses re-invested back. 
    - It is necessary to compare index fund returns with TRI and not index itself.

- Peter lynch's stock criteria,
    - Relatively debt free
    - beaten down in market
    - selling for less than cash in their bank accounts
    - If it's a choice between investing in a good company in a great industry, or a great company in a lousy industry, I'll take the great company in the lousy industry any day. Good management, a strong balance sheet, and a sensible plan of action will overcome many obstacles, but when you've got weak management, a weak balance sheet, and a misguided plan of action, the greatest industry in the world won't bail you out

- Prof Aswath damodaran 
    - the less activity you need to put into creating a portfolio, the better.
    - on Indexing 
        - many of these people who critique indexing have a very selfish reason for doing so – it’s taking away their living. And that’s for a very good reason, which is they’ve not been very good at what they do for a living and indexing has exposed that.
        -  most active investing is built on mean-reversion. It’s very lazy investing, there is no research that goes in. You just buy stocks with low PE ratios and high growth. Again, we have this vision of analysts as being people who dig for the truth – and that is still there
        - there is a potentially dark side to indexing. It has made momentum much stronger, because the nature of indexing is you pile on to whatever’s going up.
    - On Momentum 
        - Investing has always been a momentum game, at least on the pricing side, and it’s about momentum and momentum shifts. Pretty much all of trading can be summarized into those two groups: you can either be a momentum player or a player who detects shifts in momentum and tries to go against momentum just before it changes. So, all of trading is built around momentum or anti-momentum.
        - you cannot devise a trading strategy which ignores momentum. It’s impossible.
        - You can create an investing strategy that’s momentum-free – but that basically means you value something and then you sit there and pray and hope that, eventually, momentum fixes the gap for you. Even those people who believe they’re value players are far more dependent on momentum than they realize, because ultimately, for them to make money, the price has to move to its value. And that may require a momentum shift, which is what we call the catalyst, something that changes the momentum of the game.

    - Retirement and the 4% Rule - The 4% Rule: If you can live on 4% of of your investment portfolio per year, the money should last you >30 years. The inverse of this rule is often usedto calculate: "How much do I need to retire?" Retirement number = 25 x annual expenses
    -  2 reasons why you shouldn't pick individual stocks Financial reason: The majority of pro money managers can't beat the index. Can you? Existential reason: How do you conclusively know you're a good stock picker?
    - When to sell? - only reasons are, 
    - Rebalance his portfolio
    - Exit a losing position
    - Meet some immediate financial need
    - In investing, selling after a bad stretch feels like the right thing to do. You learned your lesson and seek greener pastures. But everything we know about investing shows it’s the wrong action: the big money comes from compounding uninterrupted over years and decades, when what you’ve done is not as important as how long you’ve been doing it for.Nassim Taleb says if you’re going to panic in investing, panic early. Same goes for your career – if you’re going to quit, quit early so whatever’s next has a shot at compounding.
    -  Nearly half of all stocks decline by at least 70% and never recover their previous highs as per data by JP Morgan
    - You're much more likely to end up owning one of the thousands of stocks in Under performance Land than one of the fortunate few out on the right end of the distribution.
    - That's why diversification is so important. Investing in the stock market is highly likely to pay off over many decades. Investing in a single stock is far riskier. And investors with the least capital have the most to lose. Intelligent investors should always diversify. The two exceptions are when you have control or information.
    - Control - Someone whose decisions can influence the stock price 
    - Information -  you're an investor who has objectively superior information about a company not
    available to the market as a whole, then you should use it to concentrate in the stock
    - Rules/policy/procedures should be employed wherever possible since it avoids subjective evaluation. 
    - Auto Market 
    - When a car part fails, it's the carmaker that gets the bad publicity and not the part maker, so carmakers are very careful about who gets the contract. A competitor might arrive with the best-looking aluminum wheel ever, but unless that competitor has a track record, carmakers aren't likely to give up on what already works.

- [Investment Learnings][PersonalFinance]
    - Avoid “respect quota” or keep “respect quota” limited to a tiny percentage of the portfolio. “Respect quota” is mimicking investment/ trading based on investments/trades of other investors/ traders. More often than not such mimicking results in losses.
    - Never get carried away with what others are doing.
    - As soon as you see that easy money is in the making, be more alert and cautious.
    - It is better to be slow.
    - Avoid media/WhatsApp/Telegram/social media
    - Go alone, take a break, take a deep breath, do meditation, calm down,
    - Don't be in a hurry.
    - Book profits and let someone else also earn.
    - Read good books that help.
    - Form a good circle of friends. This trusted circle should not be a source of “tips”. This circle of friends is to bounce off ideas and to check if your investment thesis has any holes.
    - Never trust any “Tips”. Remember the reverse of “Tips” is “Pits”. “Tips” take you to “Pits”.
    - Finally, NEVER TRUST ANYONE especially reputations. Keep in mind one thing that here anyone can go bankrupt if they are not disciplined and orderly.
    -  ‘A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it.’

- [Investment Criteria][PersonalFinance]
    - RoIC is 'Return on Invested Capital'. It tells us how much does a company earn annually on every Rupee that it invests. (Ideally, RoIC above 25% is considered good. RoIC above 35% is awesome.). companies with low RoIC simply DO NOT generate enough cash flow. And what happens when you do not generate enough cash flow? --> You end up relying on DEBT for expansion. Avoid financial stocks completely in this exercise. RoIC is useless to understand them.
    - Make a list of 500 companies on websites like Screener.in which highlight their RoIC and EV/EBIT. Now, create a ranking system and select the top 25 from the above list whose RoIC is highest and EV/EBIT is lowest.



- [Learning from Markets][Stocks]
    - Nothing lasts forever. When growth stocks were going up every day, it felt like it would never end. Now that growth stocks are going down, it feels like it will never end. Everything ends, eventually. 
    - Survival is the most important thing. Your portfolio must be able to weather euphoria, panic, and malaise.
    - Risk management is most critical when it feels like you’re getting punished for managing risk.
    - Nothing is a perfect inflation hedge. Not gold, stocks, crypto, or cash. Different inflation hedges work in different inflationary regimes. No one size fits all.
    - Diversification is the only answer to an unpredictable future. If everything is working, you’re not really diversified.
    - Interest rates matter a lot. The cost of money is the lifeblood of the economy and the psychological north star for investors.
    - Nothing is risk-free. The S&P 500 is down 16% year-to-date. Intermediate-term “risk-free” government bonds are down 20%.
    - You’re not a genius on the way up or an idiot on the way down.
    - When everything is going down, everybody loses money.
    - Analogs are dangerous. We know how things played out in the past. That doesn’t tell us how things will play out in the future.
    - The more confident somebody seems, the more cautious you should be in taking their advice.
    - Inflation is unpredictable.
    - Memes are not fundamentals.
    - Nobody knows what will happen next.
    - There are no new paradigms.
    - Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Past behavior is.
    - Too much leverage will eventually come back to bite you.
    - Cash is not trash.
    - You didn’t know this was going to happen. You don’t know what’s going to happen next.
    - Investing is hard.
    - never let bad market go waste


- (Personal Finance Basics (from Deepak Shenoy))[PersonalFinance]
    - Trust no one

    - Timeless wisdom from peter lynch, 
        - If timing the market is such a great strategy, why haven't we seen the names of any market timers at the top of the Forbes list of richest Americans?
        - People who exit the stock market to avoid a decline are odds-on favorites to miss the next rally. If you don't believe corporate profits will continue to rise, and you can't stomach a decline in the market, don't buy stocks or equity mutual funds.
        - If you were out of stocks in 40 key months over the past 40 years, your annual return on investment dropped from 11.4 percent to 2.7 percent. You underperformed your savings account.
        - In this century, we've had 53 corrections of 10 percent or more, roughly one every two years. We've had 15 corrections of 25 percent or more, roughly one every six years. These setbacks are normal and come with the territory.
        - A stock certificate is not a lottery ticket. Behind every stock is a company. Stock prices go up 8 percent a year, on average, because corporate profits go up 8 percent a year. Add in the dividend yield of 2.5 percent (today's levels) and stocks give you a total return of 10.5 percent. Dividends are raised, on average, by 8 percent a year, right along with corporate profits.
        - Even if we go into a long economic slump during which corporate profits grow at only half the normal rate, or 4 percent a year, stock prices should follow suit, rising an annual 4 percent a year. Assuming the 2.5 percent dividend, you would still get a 6.5 percent return, which is better than a 6 percent bond.
        - Stocks outperformed bonds in eight out of the nine previous decades in this century, and they are well ahead halfway through this one.
        - Since 1965, if you bought stocks once a year and were unlucky enough to pick the worst day to invest (when stocks were at their highest prices) 30 years in a row, you ended up with an annual return of 10.6 percent. If you were incredibly lucky and invested on the best day of the year 30 years in a row, you ended up with an annual return of 11.7 percent. So the difference between perfect timing and horrendous timing is 1.1 percent. This timing business is much ado about very little.
        - In a correction or a bear market, great companies, good companies, mediocre companies, and terrible companies all see the prices of their stocks decline. A correction is a wonderful opportunity to buy your favorite companies at a bargain price.
        -  best way to own gold is to own shares in the best mining companies or in the gold funds that
        invest in them. 

    - Real estate is a cyclical business, and most REITs are enjoying a very profitable part of the cycle. Eventually the wheel will turn, and then we'll see which REITs actually have the best holdings, the best management, and the best honest-to-goodness long- term prospects.
    - how Equity REITs work - Raise funds through IPO and promoters and borrow from elsewhere. Build or buy income-producing property. the source of income is rent paid by families/companies/stores. its required redistribute % of income as dividend.
    - Mortgage REITs - They dont buy property but instead invest in mortages taken by buildersand property owners.  They succeed only if borrowers dont default and interest rates dont go up or down sharpely. 
    - Individual investors are best off with Equity REITs.If you're a shareholder in an equity REIT, you're a landlord. If you own shares in a mortgage REIT, you're a money lender who lives and dies with interest rates.
    - The best REITs don't want to just pay dividends. They want to grow--buy more
    properties, collect more rent, drive their stock prices up.


- Equity investments
    - The best time to buy stocks is often when it feels the worst.

- Economy
    - The real economy starts, succeeds, and persists only with enough agricultural surplus to free the people for a division of labor, allowing for the existence of IBM, 3M, and McDonald’s itself. Without that agricultural surplus, the entire economy collapses; real and monetary sectors alike.
    - We have agricultural and extractive sectors at the base, heavy manufacturing sectors in the middle, and light manufacturing at the top, with service sectors intertwined throughout, serving the agricultural, extractive, and manufacturing industries in addition to household consumers.\
    - When you purchase stock through an initial public offering, you’re either helping yet another corporation take root, or an existing one expand its operations.
    - the economy grows as an integrated whole, and so does the stock market. If you’re helping one sector, you’re essentially helping them all. You may not be assisting every business competitor when you purchase a particular stock, but you are helping to expand a sector, and therefore the economy at large.

- Need for Observability
    - The higher the SLO/SLA of the service, the more observability it will require.
- Warren buffet on Stocks vs. Bonds
    - In High inflationary environment, both underperform.
    -  Investors in stocks are stuck with whatever return corporate America happens to earn. This is against fixed returns provided by Bonds.
    - To raise that return on equity, corporations would need at least one of the following:
    - an increase in turnover, i.e., in the ratio between sales and total assets employed in the business;
        - cheaper leverage;
        - more leverage;
        - lower income taxes;
        - wider operating margins on sales.
    And that’s it. There simply are no other ways to increase returns on co
    - future results will be governed by three variables: 
        - the relationship between book value and market value, 
        - the tax rate,
        -  the inflation rate.
    - If a stock has a book value of $100 and also an average market value of $100, 12 percent earnings by business will produce a 12 percent return for the investor (less those frictional costs, which we’ll ignore for the moment). If the payout ratio is 50 percent, our investor will get $6 via dividends and a further $6 from the increase in the book value of the business, which will, of course, be reflected in the market value of his holdings.If the stock sold at 150 percent of book value, the picture would change. The investor would receive the same $6 cash dividend, but it would now represent only a 4 percent return on his $150 cost. The book value of the business would still increase by 6 percent (to $106) and the market value of the investor’s holdings, valued consistently at 150 percent of book value, would similarly increase by 6 percent to ($159). But the investor’s total return, i.e., from appreciation plus dividends, would be only 10 percent versus the underlying 12 percent earned by the business. - When the investor buys in below book value, the process is reversed. For example, if the stock sells at 80 percent of book value, the same earnings and payout assumptions would yield 7.5 percent from dividends ($6 on an $80 prices) and 6 percent from appreciation—a total return of 13.5 percent.

- [Difference between ETF and MF][Stocks][PersonalFinance]
    - Because ETFs are cheaper, they can get big too fast and they almost never limit their growth in terms of AUM. Unlike mutual fund where AMC can stop inflows, ETF inflows can not be stopped. At the most, creation of new units will be halted but it means that existing units will be available at premium. This is not a problem for index tracking ETFs but it is for other (thematic or otherwise).
    - You can only buy future performance.


- [Latest from Howard marks (the decision to trim positions or to sell out entirely comes down to judgment . . . like everything else that matters in investing)][PersonalFinance] , 
    - we should base our investment decisions on our estimates of each asset’s potential,
    - we shouldn’t sell just because the price has risen and the position has swelled,
    - there can be legitimate reasons to limit the size of the positions we hold,
    - but there’s no way to scientifically calculate what those limits should be. 
    - simply being invested is by far “the most important thing.”.
    - someone entering adulthood today is practically guaranteed to be well fixed by the time they retire if they merely start investing promptly and avoid tampering with the process by trading
    - Markets swing dramatically, from bullish to bearish, and from overpriced to underpriced.
    - Their movements are driven by the actions of “the crowd,” “the herd,” and “most people.”  Bull markets occur because more people want to buy than sell, or the buyers are more highly motivated than the sellers.  The market rises as people switch from being sellers to being buyers, and as buyers become even more motivated and the sellers less so.  (If buyers didn’t predominate, the market wouldn’t be rising.)
    - Market extremes represent inflection points.  These occur when bullishness or bearishness reaches a maximum.  Figuratively speaking, a top occurs when the last person who will become a buyer does so.  Since every buyer has joined the bullish herd by the time the top is reached, bullishness can go no further, and the market is as high as it can go.  Buying or holding is dangerous.
    - Since there’s no one left to turn bullish, the market stops going up.  And if the next day one person switches from buyer to seller, it will start to go down.
    - So at the extremes, which are created by what “most people” believe, most people are wrong.
    - Therefore, the key to investment success has to lie in doing the opposite: in diverging from the crowd.  Those who recognize the errors that others make can profit enormously from contrarianism.
    - No strategy – and no level of brilliance – will make every quarter or every year a successful one.  Strategies become more or less effective as the environment changes and their popularity waxes and wanes.





- India as Market - India isn’t really one big market. There are multiple markets and markets within markets. India is not a single language market when it comes to the entertainment business. Also, not many Indians speak English.Just because India has 1.4 billion people doesn’t mean that the market for any product is as big or even a small portion of it.India and Indians seek value for money every time they spend money on something, and Netflix simply doesn’t provide that for most of us. Any form of mass communication needs to be simple enough for the average individual to understand, irrespective of whether it is writing that wants to entertain or propaganda that intends to influence.


- Eurodollar - Offshore (outside US) currency systems, denominated in US Dollars. Outside the scope of US Regulation. Has nothing to do with Euro. Timed deposits, dollar denominated deposits kept in UK Banks outside of US Jurisdiction. Instead of immediately remitting the foreign currency to the central bank or depositing it in their accounts in the U.S., banks used their dollar deposits for loans to third parties either in the U.K. or abroad. This system was supposedly very big till 2007. Global financial crisis was Eurodollar system breaking down. All the global banks are heavily involved in it. It essentially means Global money. It is US dollar denominated but a ledger, ghost money. Without the Eurodollar, Globalization might not have taken place. The US dollar denominated resources were created without actual currency involved. Fed reserve, treasury dep. or authorities in countries have no influence on eurodollar capacity. They don't have capacity, wisdom. 

- Economy#Inflation, Interest Rates etc.
    - The (US) Fed increases rates, this increases borrowing costs for banks and pretty much everyone else. Interest rates increase drive mortgage and credit card rates up, disposable income goes down. the consumer, are spending less money. When you spend less, firms sell less stuff. This in turn affects company earnings, and by extension their stock prices.
    - Stocks always compete with the safest options in the market – bank fixed deposits or government securities.This makes for an inverse relationship between interest rates and equity valuations. 
    - the excess money and easy credit light the fuse that sparks inflation. This is because the supply side does not have the confidence to grow even as easy money with the spenders drives up demand. 
    - Worry is that high interest rates would slow down economic activity, slow down demand and eat into profits
    - The US dollar is the world's reserve currency or the medium of exchange in which international trade is largely carried out and the currency in which other countries hold a good portion of their foreign exchange reserves. So, whatever the Federal Reserve does to control inflation through interest rates, impacts countries across the world, including India.
    - Treasury bonds are financial securities issued by the US government to borrow money to finance its fiscal deficit or the difference between what it earns and what it spends.
    - The American government was spending much more than it was earning. To finance the spending, it sold treasury bonds. Large financial investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and mutual funds, bought these bonds. At the same time, the Fed was buying treasury bonds from the same large financial investors and thus financing the government indirectly.

- Markets & Investing
    - A wash trade is a form of market manipulation in which an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create misleading, artificial activity in the marketplace. First, an investor will place a sell order, then place a buy order to buy from themselves, or vice versa.Wash trading works best when the market is thin. If your above-fair-price wash trades run into real orders from other traders, you’ll lose money! You want to maximize the likelihood that you actually sell to yourself. (Wash trading—investors simultaneously selling and buying the same financial assets to create artificial activity in the marketplace, which is known to distort price, volume, and volatility, and reduce investors’ confidence and participation in financial markets. )

    - One reason stocks tend to have high returns over the long run is to compensate investors for the ever-present risk of losing at least half their money in the short run.

    - virtue of great investors: skepticism. If I've learned anything in decades of reporting on investing, it's that the main product of the financial industry isn't portfolios; it's propaganda. And propaganda with numbers, cloaked in jargon, can hit investors like general anesthesia: You just drift off to sleep while financial professionals surgically remove your money.
        - When someone says, "Studies have shown that...," ask the names of the studies, where they were published and whether this person has read them in full.
        - When someone describes a "strategy," ask how that differs from a tactic.
        - When asset managers talk about "sell discipline," ask if they measure how the stocks they sell do after being sold. If the firm doesn't know that, how does it know its sell discipline works?
        - Are these past results based on a backtest? 
        - What do the results look like after trading costs, fees and taxes?
        - Do these numbers account for survivorship bias?
        - Who's on the other side of this trade, and why would they let you make so much money?
        - Is there data on the average performance of people who have tried this in the past? How did they do, and what makes me or you so special that we should believe we can do better?
        - Always read the footnotes. Read financial disclosures from back to front, as if they were written in Hebrew or Arabic. The stuff you really need to know is almost always near the back.
    - A great company is a great investment only when you pay the right price for it.

- Analyzing Balance Sheet 
    - Check "Profit before Tax" against "Net Fixed assets". See if company is generating healthy profit compared to other safe investment options like Govt. Bonds etc.

- Psychology of Money 
    - what people really want in life is independence and autonomy. Money is a conduit to gain it.


- Investing 
    - Warning signs
        - No response to queries even after followups
    - Criteria
        - Sales & Profit growth 
        - No Cyclic profits but should be consistent
        - Enough Cash flows (Profits converted into cash) 
        - Low in debt
        - Management Quality


    - when there are vast numbers of people to coordinate, and they have access to most of the information about the problem they must solve, decision-making should not be centralized. A better information management system is to give people close to the problem the mission—the why and the what—, give them the right incentives, and let them figure out how to achieve the mission.
    -  if you only have a few stocks, you will have their average return, and a slightly better risk than any portfolio independently. But if you have all the stocks in the world, you will get the best risk-adjusted reward.

- Futures
    - Futures are mark-to-market financial products, and when the futures price goes up, the short side of the futures contract has to put up money today.


- Walter schloss "Factors to make money in stock markets" 
    - Price is the most important factor 
    - Try to establish value of company, start with book value. Make sure that debt does not equal 100% of equity
    - Have patience 
    - Dont sell on bad news
    - Dont be afraid to be loner but be sure to be correct on judgement 
    - Dont be in too much hurry to sell 
    - When buying a stock, buy near low of past few years. 
    - Try to buy assets at discount than earnings. 
    - Be careful of leverage

- Personal Finance 
    - Instead of chasing short-term dopamine highs, build a portfolio around a short list of
    evidence-based rules.
    - Exercise the discipline to follow those rules. Successful investors reduce fees and stick to
    something imperfect rather than endlessly pursue perfection.
    - Loss tolerance - More important than risk tolerance. It indicates how much loss the person will be able to tolerate before he changes his mind and makes mistakes.

- Ways to identify Market Capitulation, 
    - Index providers offer us a handy tool to gauge if markets, on any given day, are in the grip of euphoria or paranoia. The India VIX, or Volatility Index, disseminated by NSE is deemed the fear gauge for Indian markets.  This index captures the annualised volatility expected by options traders in the market over the next 30 trading days. So, a VIX of 21 indicates that traders expect the Nifty50 to move at an annualised rate of 21% in the next month. While the India VIX has tended to trade in the 15 to 30 range in normal times, periods of high fear in the market have seen it shoot above 70. When selling climaxed in end-October 2008, the India VIX which was trading at 30-40 levels at the beginning of the month, shot up to over 80 to peak at 90. - it is also quite possible that the Indian markets don’t get into a capitulation phase at all for now, and simply keep moving sideways for months. When valuation bubbles burst, a time correction, where markets test investors by staying range-bound for a long spell and not breaking out in either direction, is as much of a possibility as a price-based correction. This is why it is best not to wait interminably in the hope of catching stocks at a capitulation phase. Deploy part of your cash whenever you find the stocks you want to own at attractive levels, while keeping some powder dry for that capitulation phase. This will ensure that you don’t lose out on buying opportunities, even if the mouth-watering opportunities provided by capitulation prove elusive.
    
- Physics of Market.
    -1. Momentum - The lesser I say the better given how much this concept has been used off-late. But momentum remains a tendency that works more often than not. It could be driven by price or earnings. Once a new momentum starts it opens up an opportunity to make money. beware of stale momentum. If you get into a stale momentum situation you get to face the wrath of the next law of markets.
    - 2. Mean reversion: Markets have an uncanny need to mean revert. They typically mean revert either over short term or the long term. Short term mean reversion is the playfield of intraday traders and straddle sellers. Long term mean reversion is where the value investors reside.
    - 3. Demand-Supply Dynamics: if a stock or sector is over-owned it will tend to under-perform and if it’s under owned it will be primed to outperform. The FAANGs are massively over owned after a ten year bull run and are more likely to underperform. Similarly cap goods in India is nder owned and is likely to outperform over next few years
    - 4. Growth: Markets love growth. It’s not a law but is almost one. If you can demonstrate growth in revenue to markets it will bend over backwards to give you money. That’s why new categories are the biggest winners in any market. The base is small and they give you 100% growth,
    - 5. Environment - This is probably the most important law. Just like in physics the frame of reference is key. You have to be able to figure out what type of a market environment are we in? Is it bullish, bearish, choppy or volatile or any other adjective you can think of. Similarly there is a time to be aggressive and a time to be defensive. Every major decision depends on the environment and your understanding of your strategy  vis-a-vis the current environment. Stopping a SIP in a bear market is probably the worst thing you can do as SIP. No point doing sip in a bull market. Know the market environment and make decisions accordingly. 

- On Market timing 
    -  The moment when you are feeling the most ebullient about your portfolio, when it seems like it’s going up most every day and you can’t believe how much you are making, that is the point at which you want to adjust your stock allocation down
    - If at the moment you were happiest about your investments you reduced risk, you would probably come pretty close to getting out of the market at the highs. 
    - when you are feeling the worst about your portfolio, when you have abandoned all hope and are considering just liquidating everything to stop the pain, it is probably time to be taking more risk.
    - If you can sense big turning points in sentiment, you can make subtle changes to your asset allocation and increase returns over time


- Lesson's from [Ed thorp](https://tim.blog/thorp)  
    - Buying Index as whole has earned around 10-10.5% and it should be the way to go for most of the investors 
    - Active investing involves fund selection, paying tax every time trade happens, paying financial advisors, spending time in analysis. 
    - If your time horizon is long i.e. 15-20 years or more, put 90% equities and rest in bonds. 
    - 4% rule - spend 4% or less capital each year and put rest in equities. It is mostly likely to suffice till end of life. 
    - 2% rule - Only drain 2% of net worth per year then capital will last perpetually. 
    - Externalities -Consequences of somebody's action that are usually bad 
    - “hedge fund,” is a private limited partnership that invests in wide-ranging products like  real estate loans, equities, commodities etc.
    - first fundamental thing is, if everybody’s heard about it already, there’s, historically at least, no reason to believe that you have any kind of edge.
    -  other-directed people - They tend to get their direction on their values and their ratification from people around them. So they tend to conform, and they tend to go with fads, and they tend to go with a majority vote on things.they pick up their cues about what to do and how to behave, and what’s good and what’s bad, from the crowd. Those people are afloat without a compass. And it’s harder to be that kind of person. And those people are lonely because they don’t really have anything inside that helps them feel a sense of worth, and helps them make decisions that are clear cut and that they feel like they can really count upon. 
    -  inner-directed people - they tend to be more self-deciding about things.By inner-directed, think of yourself as having your own independent moral and ethical compass, set of rules for living and guiding yourself.

- Things to always remember while investing, 
    - The first step in avoiding being taken for a ride is to recognize that you are a mark for people trying to get rich off your money.
    - Burn the principle into your brain that financial markets are large and competitive and have a lot of smart people in them.
    - Easy money-making opportunities are almost never real; professional mercenaries would have found and exploited them first.
    - High returns with low risk explained away by complicated and nontransparent strategies deserve great scrutiny.
    - On the institutional side, keep in mind that the world is a relatively small place and tremendous value can be gleaned by asking the views of people close to a particular market or strategy.
    - Ask questions; be skeptical; do not assume that just because brand-name firms or authority figures are involved that all is well.

- At the end of the day, unintelligent people always look for a scapegoat. Intelligent people are hungry for continual guidance and mentorship, take responsibility for their actions, and can control their emotions in times of instability. 
- The first principle of any investment strategy, especially if you do not have a lot of money, should be to make sure that the value of your investment does not go down dramatically because you don’t understand what you are doing and have been naively trusting someone else.
- any investment is a way of making money, and if you get so attached to it that it becomes a part of your identity

- On leveraged market strategies
    - Leverage cuts both ways: You will make more money when you are right, and lose more when you are wrong. Tragically, the extra money you make on the upside can hook you and feed your hubris, making you overstay your strategy until those huge gains turn into huge losses.

- Good Investing skills From Morgan housel,
    - Lack of FOMO
    - A well-calibrated sense of your future regret
    - A sensitive bullshit detector
    - Respecting luck as much as you respect risk
    - Identifying what game you are playing and not being persuaded by people playing different games.

- Sageone's Samit Vartak on Markets, 
    -   analysis clearly depicts that even though it’s difficult to time your entries with short term duration in mind, but one can time it with high degree of certainty keeping long term duration in mind. Entries below the median P/B of 3.5x have resulted in above average returns whereas entries above the median P/B of 4x have resulted in significantly below average returns over the long term.
    -  Stretching your horizon is a much reliable way of generating significant incremental returns.


- Double entry financial accounting.
    - Core idea is one transaction, at least two entries, one representing the source and the other representing the use of funds
    - The core principle of double-entry accounting is that every transaction should record both where the money came from and what the money was used for.
    - A ledger is a timestamped log of events that have a monetary impact.
    - An account is a discrete pool of value that represents a balance you want to track.
    - A transaction is an event recorded in the ledger.
    - Computing balance from ledger (i.e. log) is optimal than mutating balances in account 
    - uses of funds are assets and expenses. e.g. Buying inventory, making an investment, acquiring physical property, and so on
    - sources of funds—such as liabilities, equity, or revenue—can mean bank loans, investors' capital, accumulated profits, or income.
    - Accounts that represent funds you own, or uses of money, are debit normal accounts.
    - Accounts that represent funds you owe, or sources of money, are credit normal accounts.
    - Entries can be added onto the ledger “on the debit side” or “on the credit side." Debits and credits refer to how a given entry will affect an account’s balance:
    - Debits—or entries on the debit side—increase the balance of debit normal accounts, while credits decrease it.
    - Credits—or entries on the credit side—increase the balance of credit normal accounts, while debits decrease it.If the sum of balances of all credit normal account

    - A common misconception is that one account needs to decrease while another needs to increase. However, they can both increase or decrease in tandem, depending on the debit and credit entries in the transaction and the account types.
    - A system of accounts will balance as long as the balance on debit normal accounts equals the balance on credit normal accounts

- System Characteristics 
    - Concurrency—relating to the number of concurrent users, sensors, and other devices that create events to which the product must respond.
    - Throughput—relating to the volume of transactions or data that the product must be able to process over a defined time period.
    - Latency and responsiveness—relating to how quickly the product must respond to events.
    - Scalability—relating to the ability of a system to handle an increased workload by increasing the cost of the system, general in a near-linear relationship.
    - Persistency—relating to the throughput and structure (or lack thereof) of data that must be stored and retrieved by the product. Often includes decisions about different kinds of data storage technologies (e.g. SQL DBMS, NoSQL DBMS, etc.).
    - Security—relating to how the product will protect itself from unauthorized use or access to product data, by achieving confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    Monitoring—relating to how the product will be instrumented so that the people who support the product can understand when the product starts to fail to meet QARs and prevent critical system issues.
    - Platform—relating to how the product will meet QARs related to system resource constraints such as memory, storage, event signaling, etc. For example, real-time and embedded products (such as a digital watch, or an automatic braking system) have quite different constraints than cloud-based information systems.
    - User interface—relating to decisions made about how the product will communicate with users; for example, virtual reality interfaces have quite different QARs than 2-dimensional graphical user interfaces, which have quite different QARs than command-line interfaces. These decisions may affect other QARs noted above. (GUI, VR, command line, or other kinds of interfaces.)

- Notes from Last letter of Prashant jain 
	- As is often the case in investing, herd behaviour and majority opinion is more often wrong than right
	-  ESG has noble objectives but the answer to solving these issues is not in mechanical scores (at times deficient) and in exclusion investing, rather in encouraging / incentivising companies to adopt more ESG friendly technologies, processes and mechanisms via market forces and other means
	- efficient markets hypothesis does not hold true, especially over short to medium periods. 
	-Equities are a generous asset class. The tailwind of a growing economy and growing companies overshadows mistakes of timing and security selection in diversified portfolios in most cases over long periods. The key is patience to stay invested for long periods.
	- Active vs. Passive - While outperforming benchmarks is not easy and will probably get tougher, especially net of expenses, some managers should be able to outperform over time. In most cases, this out performance is however unlikely to be linear or consistent. Significant divergence of portfolios from benchmarks and consequently a higher tracking error (that many equate to risk, though there are strong arguments to the contrary) will be needed in many cases to overcome the hurdle of costs and to generate alpha over long periods in my judgement

- Banks
	- Branches are sales offices. They exist to sell new accounts.
	- bank assumes that, in expectation, well-qualified customers are making a 10+ year commitment.
	- Net interest margin (spread) - A bank’s advantage versus every other business in the economy, and the reason why they are the economy’s major source of credit, is the ability to leverage their capital via the use of borrowed money. Much of those borrowings are cheap or free to the bank, in the form of deposits. Net interest is the difference between the rates banks pay on their deposits and what they take in from their loan book. 
	- most of the retail deposit base is, structurally, older, wealthier depositors who are at or near retirement. In a real sense, the branch exists for them and your ability to use it is a courtesy.This is also the main reason why branches have not disappeared despite their immense cost and the feasibility of doing almost all bank transactions through other channels. The banks’ favorite customers like them a lot.
	- Affluent account holders of the bank (Retirees, doctors etc.) are serviced by commissioned sales professional who carefully presents as different social class than regular branch employee.
	- Larger banks treat small businesses largely as a necessary detail to attract wealthy retail depositors, because a large portion of wealthy people own or operate businesses
	- Staff @ bank branches
		- with the sophistication of information technology, banks have been distributing functions among branches rather than deploying all functions to each branch.
		- a typical bank branch will have about six employees: one manager, one to two tellers, and the remainder bankers.	
		- Bankers are basically all commissioned sales representatives who are generally in a high-pressure sales environment, with the branch manager being a quota-driving line sales manager. They are discouraged from spending their time on transactions except to the extent necessary to sell more accounts.
		- branch managers are no longer CEO of the branch involved in underwriting decisions on loan or make accommodations for customers.

- Investing in Small caps 
	- They should not be part of core portfolio
	- Commit meaningful amounts
	- Bet for long haul
	- Factors while choosing
		- potential to grow faster than GDP, Promoter quality, Accounting quality, Free Cash Flow, Past growth rates, 
		- Commodity stocks are unlikely to fit here 
		- should grow top line without constraints (like auto ancilliaries constrained by size of auto industry). Retail business could possibly fit in here
		- Acrysil - manufacture a product that is always going to be needed and they have the quality. The potential to grow is big.
		- Wait for small caps to be recognized by Market.
		- Go for those having healthy ROCE (Well above cost of debt)
		- Promoter holding should be high.Typically,a  good company will not make a follow on offer but IPO followed by one or two rounds of QIP should be ok.
		- Check for promoter quality

- Economic principles 
	- There is no such thing as a free lunch. When someone gets something, they almost always give something up in return. 
	-  try, when possible, to put numbers on things.

- Charlie Munger's Wisdom 
	- Braun's rule of Five W's
		- who was going to do what, where, when and why
    - huge productivity increases that would come from a better machine introduced into the production of a commodity product would all go to the benefit of the buyers of the product (textiles). Nothing was going to stick to owners.
    -  it makes sense to load up on the very few good insights you have instead of pretending to know everything about everything at all times. 
    - Over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns.
    - betting on the quality of a business is better than betting on the quality of management. 
    - In fact, any time anybody offers you anything with a big commission and a 200- page prospectus, don't buy it.

- Munger - there’s great opportunities for excess and nasty contractions after unnatural booms and so on.
    - Inverted expertise - Overconfidence grows worse as people become more expert in a given field. 
    - Representativeness (sometimes called “the law of small numbers”) is the human tendency to consider short series of data to be typical of long-term trends.
    - Availability, meanwhile, is the natural inclination to let recent and vivid events overwhelm our judgment about normal expected outcomes

- Economics
	- Profits on sale are different than profits on investments. This is because profit on sale involves costs like employees, utility expenses, taxes on suppliers etc.
	- In virtually all jobs, the quality of equipment, management and other workers goes into determining worker's productivity.
	- Combination of supply and demand determines the prices of goods and services.
	- Capitalism 
		- Profit is a price paid for efficiency
		- Business owner acting as monitor for the economic efficiency of the business is one enormous advantage.
    - Robust property rights for individuals and governments with clear restraints on executive power, democratic political processes and a lack of government corruption were all associated with economic growth. 

- General 
	- any subject area has a core / fundamental area (the science) and an applied area (use of the technique or application repeatedly towards the same or different problems)

- Notes from "how to correct money mistakes", 
	- Mental Accounting 
		- you don’t think you’re a reckless spender, but you have trouble saving. 
		- you have savings in the bank and revolving balances on your credit cards. 
		-  you’re more likely to splurge with a tax refund than with savings. 
		- you seem to spend more when you use credit cards than when you use cash
		-  most of your retirement savings are in fixed-income or other conservative investment

	- Decision paralysis 
		- you have a hard time choosing among investment options. 
		- you don’t contribute to retirement plans at work. 
		- you tend to beat yourself up when your decisions turn out poorly. 
		- you frequently buy things that offer “trial periods”—but infrequently take advantage and return them. 
		- you delay making investment or spending decisions. 

	- Number numbness
		- you invest in last year’s hot mutual funds. 
		-  you have very low insurance deductibles. 
		-  you don’t really understand the relationship between inflation and buying power. 
		-  you invest without much concern about commission costs and management fees. 
		- you ignore the implications of compound interest and let your credit-card balances carry over. 
		-  you don’t really understand compound interest. 

	- Confirmation bias or anchoring 
		- you’re especially confident about your ability to negotiate and bargain. 
		- you make spending and investment decisions without much research. 
		- you’re especially loyal to certain brands for mindless reasons. 
		- you find it hard to sell investments for less than you paid. 
		- you rely on sellers to set a price rather than assessing the value yourself. 

	- Overconfidence 
		- you’re especially confident about your ability to negotiate and bargain. 
		- you make spending and investment decisions without much research. 
		- you’re especially loyal to certain brands for mindless reasons. 
		- you find it hard to sell investments for less than you paid. 
		- you rely on sellers to set a price rather than assessing the value yourself. 

	- Following the herd 
		- you make investment decisions frequently. 
		- you invest in “hot” stocks or other popular investments. 
		- you sell investments because they’re suddenly out of favor, not because your opinion of them has otherwise changed. 
		- you’re likely to buy when stock prices are rising and sell when they are falling.
		- you make spending and investment decisions based solely on the opinions of friends, colleagues, or financial advisers. 
		- your spending decisions are heavily influenced by which products, restaurants, or vacation spots are “in.” 

	- Reflexive financial thinking 
		- you spend money in impulsive bursts. 
		- you shop when you’re feeling blue. 
		- you tend to buy extended warranties or extra insurance policies, just to be safe. 
		- you feel extraordinarily anxious when stock prices fall, even if you don’t need your invested money for years to come. 
		- you tend to hold on to winning investments well beyond the price you think the security is worth. 
		- you routinely spend more for goods and services than you planned to. 

	- Sunk cost fallacy 
		- you make important spending decisions based on how much you’ve already spent. 
		- you generally prefer bonds over stocks. 
		- you tend to sell winning investments more readily than losing ones. 
		- you’re seriously tempted to take money out of the stock market when prices fall.

- Pulak prasad's book
    - Aim is for Permanent ownership
    - We don’t invest in businesses run by crooks, we detest turn-arounds, we stay as far away from leverage as possible, we refuse to engage with M&A addicts, we can’t figure out fast-changing industries, and we don’t align ourselves with unaligned owners.
    - Majority of Mergers and acquisitions fail
    - Investors can re-imagine investing by studying and understanding the history of a business and an industry instead of constantly obsessing over the future.
    - The median trailing price/earnings (PE) ratio for our portfolio at the time of our investment is less than 15 when the Indian market has been about 19 to 20. We have rarely ever paid more than twenty times trailing PE.
    - Most of our portfolio comprises businesses with only one product or service or a small set of related products and services. We refuse to invest in diversified companies or conglomerates
    - Darwin, the founder of modern evolutionary theory, understood better than anyone before him that the present was the result of the cumulative effect of the past.
    - Zahavi’s handicap principle contends that a signal that is costly to produce is honest and can thus be relied upon by the receiver. The “cost” may be in the form of additional resources required to produce the signal or an increased risk of mortality.
    - In nature, the “sender” of a signal attempts to influence the behavior of the “receiver.” For the receiver, differentiating between an honest and a dishonest signal can be the difference between life and death. Dishonest signals include press releases, management meetings, investor conferences and earnings guidance. Honest signals include past operating and financial performance and scuttlebutt signals from suppliers, customers, competitors, ex-employees and industry experts.
    - Stasis is the default in the business world, too. Great businesses generally stay great, and bad businesses generally remain bad. This is evident not only from my personal experience of investing in India over a few decades but also from empirical data from the United States on the longevity of high-quality businesses.
    - short-term changes do not usually impact the long-term character of an exceptional enterprise.
    - characteristics of Robust business, 
        - Has delivered high historical ROCE over a long period
        - Has a fragmented customer base
        - Has no debt and has excess cashIs highly leveraged
        - Has built high competitive barriers
        - Has a fragmented supplier baseIs dependent on a few suppliers
        - Has a stable management team
        - Industry is slow changing
    - Typical selection criteria
        - Promoter's integrity - Forensic due diligence and also studying past history
        - Excess cash 
        - Maximum Debt/Equity Ratio not exceeding 0.3 (Debt diminishes strategic flexibility and hence long-term value creation.) 
        - If a business is a serial acquirer, we stay away.
        - we will not invest in
            -  a government-owned enterprise at any price
            - listed subsidiaries of global giants
            - Indian conglomerates (Tata, birla, ambani ....). This is because value creation is possible only thorough sustained focus 
        - Historically delivered ROCE. ROCE is simply the operating profit of the business as a percentage of total capital employed. As defined earlier, operating profit is earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT. ROCE = EBIT ÷ (net working capital + net fixed assets)
            - What does a high ROCE of, say, 20 percent tell us? A simple fact: This business earns $20 for every $100 it invests.
        - Buy when the price is right.

- Naked short - Shorting the stock before borrowing it. (Shorting a stock requires that shares be borrowed from someone)


- Mutual fund portfolio Suggestions
    - Avoid thematic funds at all cost
    - US Exposure - NASDAQ or S&P 500 index fund
    - Large/Midcap - one each of Nifty 100 and Nifty Midcap 150 based index funds
    - Smallcap - Active Smallcap fund
    - Debt - 2 each of short term and corporate bond fund.


- Rakesh Jhunjhnwala - Trading is to earn capital while investing is to grow capital.


- Stay the course -- by owning broad market index funds - https://janav.wordpress.com/2024/03/04/stay-the-course/


- Contrarian EPS - 
  - Selection Criteria 
    - Active funds - (50% in Index funds). Funds with less than 50 stocks and turnover less than 25%. 
    - Stocks - 10year ROCE > 15% and Ev/EBIT < 14x
  - high switching costs. To totally abandon something and replace it with something new takes a lot of courage on the part of decision maker. If it bombs there is a career risk. 

- Types of Analysts
  - The main differences between buy-side and sell-side analysts are the type of firm that employs them and the people to whom they make recommendations.
  - Sell-side firms include broker-dealers, investment banks, and market makers that give investment services to the rest of the market.
  - Buy-side firms include asset managers, hedge funds, and other companies that trade securities for their clients.
  - Buy-side analysts evaluate an investment's potential and whether it aligns with a fund's investment strategy.
  - Sell-side analysts are known for issuing recommendations such as "strong buy," "outperform," "neutral," or "sell." These analysts typically have more time to learn the ins and outs of an industry

- Warren buffet's advice (Sourced from: https://fortune.com/2014/02/24/buffetts-annual-letter-what-you-can-learn-from-my-real-estate-investments/)

    - I have good news for these nonprofessionals: The typical investor doesn’t need this skill. In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, in unpredictable fits and starts). In the 20th century, the Dow Jones industrial index advanced from 66 to 11,497, paying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The 21st century will witness further gains, almost certain to be substantial. The goal of the nonprofessional should not be to pick winners — neither he nor his “helpers” can do that — but should rather be to own a cross section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-cost S&P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.
    - That’s the “what” of investing for the nonprofessional. The “when” is also important. The main danger is that the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then become disillusioned when paper losses occur. (Remember the late Barton Biggs’s observation: “A bull market is like sex. It feels best just before it ends.”) The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over a long period and never sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the “know-nothing” investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimal is virtually certain to get satisfactory results. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long-term results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness.
    - My money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certain instructions I’ve laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife’s benefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the 10 years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s. (VFINX)) I believe the trust’s long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors — whether pension funds, institutions, or individuals — who employ high-fee managers.

- Jason Zweig on Investing, 
  - Benjamin Graham himself was a vocal advocate of index funds — before they even existed. He helped pioneer the idea that investors should be able to buy the whole stock market in a passive package.I don't believe that index funds undermine your independence as an investor and cause you to "follow everyone else in the market." In fact, they should be able to help you do the opposite. If you're what Graham called a "defensive" investor who doesn't have the time and energy to analyze and monitor individual assets, then an index fund sets you free: You can pay no attention to the market's short-term fluctuations, knowing that you will capture its long-term returns.What if you're what Graham called an "enterprising" investor who's willing to commit the effort to study stocks thoroughly before (and after) you buy them?Then you can put, say, 90% of your stock money in a total-market index fund. Take the other 10% and invest in a small number of individual stocks you analyze meticulously and hold patiently. Treat declines as buying opportunities. Favor companies followed by few analysts, shunned by the crowd, forgotten by the "finfluencers."Having most of your money in an index fund means that even if your individual stock picks stink, your overall portfolio will still do nearly as well as the market. On the other hand, if do you turn out to be a great stock picker, there's no limit to how much your picks can add to your portfolio.This way, an index fund can make you more independent. 


- Book: In service of republic, 
  - A state is a human community that claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory.
  -  The market economy yields good outcomes for society when, and only when, there are high levels of competition.Competition pushes firms to cut costs, to innovate, and to deliver the best bargains for customers. 
  -  Creative destruction is the ceaseless process where people try out ideas, build a
    business, and when they find that it does not work, they close it down.
  - The willingness of entrepreneurs to start a business requires an economic environment of limited liability, where the entrepreneur will be able to give up, put the firm into the bankruptcy process, and walk out of it with nothing more than a bruised ego, reputational damage, and valuable experience. A society that pillories entrepreneurs, and turns business failure into protracted disputes or
entanglement in agencies, is one which will have less entrepreneurship.
  - We normally see a few firms or an industry at a time. But actually, all parts of the economy are connected together in ‘general equilibrium’. Every change in one firm or one market induces ripples in every other market. The full general equilibrium effects play out slowly.
  - It is better to change the incentives of the perpetrator, rather than redress the loss of the victim.
  - Occam's Razor - When two alternative tools yield the same outcome, we should prefer the one which uses the least coercion/simple explaination. 
  - Externalities are the situations in which persons impact upon each other that is not intermediated through voluntary agreements between these persons.
  - In every organization, there are front-line producers and then there is an enormous overhead of monitoring, measurement, management and strategy. A low teeth-to-tail ratio is required for the organization to work well.
  - Private firms keep score using profits or share prices. There is no comparable dashboard in government. Private firms have competitors, and face the threat of going out of business, while the government is a monopolist that will never go out of business.
  - In all large organizations, there are principal–agent problems. The employees care about their own interests, and not the objective of the organization.Management is about establishing procedures for overcoming this conflict of interest.
  - Three cross-cutting problems that are found in all organizations are human resource management, the financial process and the procurement process.
  - The state is the most powerful actor in society.
  - Only power of a government is a coercive power. A government can force people to do certain things, and a government can force people to pay taxes. State paternalism can then only be in favour of some and not All.
  - Coercive power gives the state the ability to take from one and give to another, and this will
    make some people happy at the expense of others. Paternalism by the government is an impossibility
  - To understand what the state should do, we should first appreciate what free men and women do all by themselves. Most of the great achievements of mankind can be traced to the creativity and drive of free persons
  - All state activities fall into two categories. In the first case, the state can use force to modify behaviour. In the second case, the state obtains tax revenues and spends this money in certain ways. But obtaining tax revenues is itself done through the threat of violence.
  - public goods such as clean air are 'non-rival' and 'non-excludable' (No private firm would produce public goods).
  - Types of Market failure , Externalities, public goods, market power and asymmetric information.
  - The world of public policy is about these three levers: rules about behaviour, taxation, and spending money
  - Market power: One party in the negotiation has little power and experiences a loss of choice.
  - Asymmetric information: The process of negotiation works poorly as there is a lack of information.
  - Externalities: There are channels of influence between two parties that are not negotiated.
  - Public goods: The individual is not given the opportunity to negotiate and choose.
  - Without high-quality fine-grained data, management is impossible.
  - Without deep roots in knowledge, the policy process degenerates into a contest of political and business special interests that harness the coercive power of the state to their own ends. Where we do not have high intellectualism, we get raw power play. 
  -  marginal cost of public funds (MCPF). The MCPF tells us the cost to society of Re 1 of public spending. This is typically much larger than Re 1.
  - In india, We tend to denigrate the knowledge obtained from the analysis of data, from meetings in air-conditioned offices
  - Public choice theory
    - we should stop searching for heroes and that we should not concentrate power in any one person.
    - The capability of an institution lies not in personnel choices but in the arrangement of information, incentives and power.
    - A sound institution is characterized by checks and balances that create forces of accountability and push leadership to serve people rather than pursue their own self-interest.
    - teaches us that enforcement personnel are not benign. Strong limitations are required on their behaviour.
    - encourages us to think that all officials and all politicians are cut from the same cloth.
    - to construct systems of checks and balances, that will work through rational incentives of all parties, and without assumptions that any one person is a saint.
    - views every official and every politician as purely self interested.
    - should design institutions assuming self-interested actors, and we will do better to the extent that some saints are recruited.
    - People think intelligently about their own self-interest and change their behaviour in response to changed incentives.
    - In public policy discussions, we are not allowed to ask for a change in the mindset
    - The puzzle of policy design is that of finding the checks and balances, and the rules of the game, through which politicians and officials will generate good outcomes for society when they pursue their own self interest.
    - The first thing that we learn in economics is to respect the preferences of others. When we see someone else doing something that appears incomprehensibly wrong, there is generally a good logic in favour of those decisions, based on the preferences and budget constraints of that person. Liberalism—the respect for the values, beliefs and decisions of others—is integral to economics as it is to no other branch of human knowledge
    - Human behaviour is not fixed; it changes when the incentives change.
    - arbitrage is the basic human instinct of removing the difference between two different prices for the same thing, and earning a profit while doing this.
    - We should have greater respect for self-organizing systems that do not require state capacity
    - Institutionalized application of mind -is a way of ensuring that the right questions are asked, and alternatives evaluated, before a decision is made
   - Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice; all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things. All governments which thwart this natural course, which force things into another channel, or which endeavour to arrest the progress of society at a particular point, are unnatural, and to support themselves are obliged to be oppressive and tyrannical.    
   - Three pilars of economic growth, 
     - High productivity firms, 
       - Specialization (do few things and do that real well)
       - Learning by doing 
       - Globalization (Remove all barriers at border)
