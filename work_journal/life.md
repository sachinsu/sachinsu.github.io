- David sinclair takeaways for healthy life 
    - Eat less often (Skip a meal), don't snack
    - avoid sugary drinks and food
    - reduce meat intake and opt for more plant based diet
    - choose the veggies that are stressed out 
    - Put the sugar at the end of the meal

- [Recommendations for Food intake][Health]
    - Liquid calories are not same as solid calories. Avoid liquid calories as body is not able to effectively apply measuring mechanism as it does with solid calories due to million years of evolution.
    - Things to check,
       - Eat as little as possible.(Eat less often)
        - Pay attention to fructose intake - eat less of super sweet fruits like mangoes and banana and more of less sweet fruits like Melons, guava. Get rid of fruit juices
        - Sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose - so consider using Glucon-D instead of white sugar Since it has 100% glucose
        - Honey and jaggery are mostly fructose. So eat less of it. Jaggery is 90% same as sugar. 
        - Starches are actually long chains of glucose.
    - More you feed gut bacteria , good it is. Shift diet to whole grains like red rice,Rajma. reduce maida,ata. Go large on portion of dal and small on rice. Switch to Millets
    - Use ghee.  Fat reduces rate at which blood sugar spikes
    - Getting body into ketosis (16 or more hours of fasting) is very beneficial
    - Veg people should pay attention to protein intake. Eat Dals. Consume dairy products.
    - Stop paying attention to carbohydrates and not fats.
    - Food is bad if coming out of packet. Be as close as you can of animal and plants you are eating. Closer our diets to what our great grand mothers ate, better it is.

- Health (Book: Why we get obese?) 
    - Obesity and overweight, so we’ll be told, are associated with an increased risk of virtually every chronic disease that ails us—heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, dementia, asthma.
    -  two factors will essentially determine how much fat we accumulate, both having to do with the hormone insulin. First, when insulin levels are elevated, we accumulate fat in our fat tissue; when these levels fall, we liberate fat from the fat tissue and burn it for fuel. This has been known since the early 1960s and has never been controversial. Second, our insulin levels are effectively determined by the carbohydrates we eat—not entirely, but for all intents and purposes. The more carbohydrates we eat, and the easier they are to digest and the sweeter they are, the more insulin we will ultimately secrete, meaning that the level of it in our bloodstream is greater and so is the fat we retain in our fat cells.
    - “Carbohydrate is driving insulin is driving fat"
    - the stimulation of insulin secretion caused by eating easily digestible, carbohydrate rich foods: refined carbohydrates, including flour and cereal grains, starchy vegetables such as potatoes, and sugars, like sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup. These carbohydrates literally make us fat, and by driving us to accumulate fat, they make us hungrier and they make us sedentary. 

    - FOODS THAT MUST BE EATEN EVERY DAY: 
        - Salad Greens: 2 cups a day. Includes arugula, bok choy, cabbage (all varieties), chard, chives, endive, greens (all varieties, including beet, collards, mustard, and turnip), kale, lettuce (all varieties), parsley, spinach, radicchio, radishes, scallions, and watercress.

        - Snacks: Pork rinds/skins; pepperoni slices; ham, beef, turkey, and other meat roll-ups;
        deviled eggs.
        - Insulin is the anabolic (building) hormone, and its primary job is to turn excess food into fat for future use. Insulin is a life-saving hormone without which humans wouldn’t have existed for a long time(Imagine storing food as abdominal fat and then giving energy until you find food). Now put this in perspective: eating every day, in fact, 3-4 times a day, insulin raises every time we eat, especially with refined carbohydrates, but it can also do protein and fat. Obesity rates are soaring all over the world(reason above). Insulin can be good and can also be equally harmful. Excess insulin leads to Diabetes, Inflammation, Atherosclerosis(Heart Disease), Obesity Etc

- Dr. Jamnadas on fasting
    - Ketosis - Fasting results in  lower Insulin levels which results in energy drawn from fats. Fats get converted to tryglcerides and fatty acids. These goto liver and converted to keytons.
    - Low carb, low sugar diet helps get into keto genesis much faster.
    - As long as insulin levels are high, one can not lose weight.
    - Autophagy is the body's way of cleaning out damaged cells, in order to regenerate newer, healthier cells.
    - High glycemic index fruits - Pineapple. Cherries. Mango. Papaya. Grapes. Kiwis. Watermelon. Cantaloupe.
    - Good, low glycemic index fruits - Berries, citrus fruits and Apples, peaches, plums and apricot, pears
    - Too much protein is troublesome. Increases risk of cancer. Taking protein powder is not a good idea. 
    - Tea , coffee without cream, sugar is ok during fasting 
    - No processed/refined food. No Sugar. Reduce Carbs. 

- Ashok Krish - Detested memorizing stuff. Exams are test of time than knowledge and analytical ability. Understand things from first principles, basic heuristics , models & metamodels. Avoid Hard manual labour, picks things that can be broken down and mastered. In terms of Indian cooking, tacit knowledge is no where captured. Health and nutrition is very complex subject.
    - Fats - they dont undergo any chemical changes till they reach intestine. Essentially replacement for Water at High temperature. 
    - Fats do not cause insulin spike 
    - Need certain amount of Fats.avoid trans-fats & refined oils. Always use refined oil for frying. 
    - Moderate ghee, butter are fine.
    - All spice flavours are fat soluble. Always spice add powders at the end and whole spices in fat i.e. Oil.
    - Carbohydrates, 
        - try to eat those has much fiber..Potatoes are better than grains.
    - Avoid direct sugars. 
    - Salt & Sugar sensors are at the tip of the tongue.
    - Avoid any liquid that has sugar in it. 
    - Cook vegetables and meat separately as both require different kind of heat. 
    - People tend to skeptical when it comes to food which is natural. 
    - Cooking generally has some degree of undoing like acid for bitter, dehydrate if soggy etc.
    - Restaurants exploit craving for salty, sweet and fatty tastes


- Food and Health
    - Potato is starch which gets converted into Glucose. Glucose is less damaging than fructose.
    - Sugar is 50-50% fructose and glucose. Glucose gets absorbed by Body, fructose can be processed only by Liver and gets converted to Fat.
    - For a healthy heart, keep ratio triglycerides to HDL should be 2 or less.
    -  avoid sugar, fructose, fine flour and vegetable oil
    - Human body is optimized for fasting and feasting 
    - Human body has enough vitamins and other nutrients for many days.
    - It’s the combination of sugar, fat, and salt that make foods ‘hyper-palatable’ and drives us to want and eat more
    - If you find you have certain foods that trigger you to overeat, don’t eat or keep these foods in the house. The more you decrease your exposure to these foods, the more likely you are to succeed with your diet. Studies suggest when people reduce the palatability of the diet, they’re more likely to succeed and keep the weight off in the long-term.
    - Serving foods with smaller plates may reduce the amount of food you eat and decrease calorie intake.
    - Don’t keep snacks around your desk while working. If you do want to grab a snack, make sure it’s kept in the office kitchen. The simple act of making it harder to get to will reduce the chances of mindless eating.
    - Pay attention. Don’t assume just because it’s called a salad, it’s zero-calorie and healthy. Most restaurants have the ingredients listed in the menu, check the salad to make sure there aren’t any extra toppings. If there are you can factor these into your calorie count for the day or simply ask the restaurant not add these when they make your food – remember, you’re paying them.


- How to get useful answers to your questions
    - ask yes/no questions
    - state your current understanding
    - be willing to interrupt
    - don’t accept responses that don’t answer your question
    - being good at extracting information is a superpower

- Food
    - Fermentation is the process by which microorganisms—bacteria, molds, yeasts—break down food and drink and by doing so preserve them and make them more delicious and nutritious. Some food and drink ferments beloved worldwide include cheese, leavened breads, cured meats, wine, soy sauce, miso, sauerkraut, and sour pickles.


- [How your organization works](https://copyconstruct.medium.com/know-how-your-org-works-or-how-to-become-a-more-effective-engineer-1a3287d1f58d)[Work]
    - Organizations usually reward those who "get the job done"
    - Necessary to understand skills that get rewarded 
    - Soft skills are hard skills
    - Understand implicit hierarchies 
    - Know the culture - Top-down or bottom-up
    - In all the mess that has evolved over long time, it is important to, 
    - how to gather just the right amount of information to get on with your task
    - how to reproduce bugs quickly without elaborate local configurations and setups
    - how to read a lot of code at a fast clip and come away with a reasonably good mental model of what it’s trying to do
    - how to come up with hypothesis and use a variety of general purpose techniques and tools to validate the hypothesis
    - Look for small wins

- First principles 
    - Process of Socratic questioning
        - Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?) 
        - Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) 
        - Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?) 
        - Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?) 
        - Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?) 
        - Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?) 
    
    - Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of history and conventional wisdom and see what is possible. When you really understand the principles at work, you can decide if the existing methods make sense. Often they don’t.  Many people mistakenly believe that creativity is something that only some of us are born with, and either we have it or we don’t. Fortunately, there seems to be ample evidence that this isn’t true. We’re all born rather creative, but during our formative years, it can be beaten out of us by busy parents and teachers. As adults, we rely on convention and what we’re told because that’s easier than breaking things down into first principles and thinking for yourself. Thinking through first principles is a way of taking off the blinders. Most things suddenly seem more possible. 

- Psychology 
    - Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice
    - What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences

- Charles' Rules of Argument  (https://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/03/21/charles_rules_of_argument)
    -  You will never change anyone's mind on a matter of opinion. People change their minds gradually, and if anything a prolonged argument only serves to back someone into a corner, huddling closer to the security blanket of what they believe. 
    - Never seek out things to disagree with. There are too many of them out there, and correcting the ills of the world just isn't your job.
    - If you come across something you disagree with while randomly browsing, let it pass without comment (see rule 1). If it's truly frustrating, write a reply, then delete it without sharing it with anyone else.
    - Even in the limited scope remaining, it is not your job to correct everything you find that you disagree with. Try to limit yourself to things where the subject is at least something that makes some practical difference to your life.
    - Do not argue about politics, religion, or matters of personal taste or comparative morality.
    - DO NOT argue with Lisp programmers, believers in the Semantic Web, or furries.
    - Saying something controversial in your own space (i.e. your weblog) is only arguing if you directly reference somebody you are disagreeing with (or it is clearly understood in subtext who you are disagreeing with), and that person is likely to give a shit about what you said.
    -  If someone disagrees with something you've said, you're already in an argument. 
    - Once you find yourself in an argument, your job is now to make your point clearly, and then leave.
        - State your case - Once you have stated your case, there's no point re-stating it.Going over the same ground repeatedly will damage your case.
        - Clarify any misunderstandings 
        - The ideal attitude to project during any argument is one of calm disinterest. 
        - Any emotional involvement you show is a weakness that can be exploited by your opponent.Even being passionate about your subject is dangerous, because over time passion becomes zeal, and zeal becomes shrillness.  

- Stoicism, 
    - Stoicism maintains that you should only focus on what YOU can control.  if you can't control it, there is no decision, and no virtue involved.And therefore it can neither make your life better nor worse.
    - Stoicism isn't about not needing friends, for example. It's about being able to bear the loss or lack of friends in the best way. It's about remaining self-fulfilled even after that love has ended, whether in heartbreak or grief.
    - Stoicism is unusually emphatic about action. To *do* is baked into the fabric of the Stoic philosophy.

- Work day,
    - Sit to do computer work. Sit using a height-adjustable, downward titling keyboard tray for the best work posture, then every 20 minutes stand for 8 minutes AND MOVE for 2 minutes. The absolute time isn’t critical but about every 20-30 minutes take a posture break and stand and move for a couple of minutes.  Simply standing is insufficient. Movement is important to get blood circulation through the muscles. And movement is FREE! Research shows that you don’t need to do vigorous exercise (e.g. jumping jacks) to get the benefits, just walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of creating greater movement variety in the workplace (e.g. walk to a printer, water fountain, stand for a meeting, take the stairs, walk around the floor, park a bit further away from the building each day).So the key is to build frequent movement variety into the normal workday

- In the absence of variety, bad ideas tend to stick around, which is also exactly what happens in closed societies and large corporations.
- Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available. The real world is often very boring. 
- People’s expectations rise faster than living standards, so a society that becomes exponentially wealthier can see a decline in net happiness and satisfaction. There is virtually nothing people can’t get accustomed to, which also helps explain why there is so much desire for innovation and improvement.

- Principled negotiation techniques
    - Separate people from the problem
    - Focus on interests not positions 
    - Generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do
    - Insist that results be based on some objective standard (like market value, expert opinion, custom or law)

- Three rules of thumb
    - Anchoring rule - Use the first available piece of information as the basis for making an estimate about something that has absolutely nothing to do with that information.
    - Representative heuristics (or Rule of typical things) - choose intuition over logic. Belief about typicality. It 'generally favors outcomes that make good
    stories or good hypotheses. It is particularly good for learning from the very worst sort of experiences.
    - Availability heuristics - 

- Leadership
    - Watching video games is like living other people's life.
    - Living in the past is like living someone else's life.
    - It is good to try achieve things but dont get fixated with outcome.
    - We are here to make positive difference in life and not being smart or right
    - Make peace with decision who has power to make it 
    - Questions 
        - Did i do my best to, 
            - set clear goals
            - progress towards achieving my goal
            - be happy
            - build positive relationships


- Religions
    - Churches thrive on obsession. Obsessed believers become missionaries, preachers, and evangelists. Obsession is a feature, not a flaw, of religion.
    - Nothing is more persuasive than the opinion you desperately want to believe is true.
    - Religion is a core component of identity for billions of people. Religion provides structure, a moral compass, and a sense of right and wrong. Religion gives us a sense of purpose. The belief in a higher power, whether it be God, Allah, or Yahweh, shelters us against the fear of death and the infinite unknown.
    - "I never desire to converse with a man who has written more than he has read."

- Thomas Sowell's Quotes
    - Intellect is not wisdom
    - When you want to help people, you tell them the truth. When you want to help yourself, you tell them what they want to hear.
    - People who pride themselves on their "complexity" and deride others for being "simplistic" should realize that the truth is often not very complicated.What gets complex is evading the truth.
    - Bailing out people who made ill-advised mortgages makes no more sense than bailing out people who lost their life savings in Las Vegas casinos.
    - The problem isn't that Johnny can't read. The problem isn't even that Johnny can't think.The problem is that Johnny doesn't know what thinking is. He confuses it with feeling.
    - It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance.
    - There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.
    - Despite a voluminous and often fervent literature on "income distribution," the cold fact is that most income is not distributed: It is earned.
    - The great escape of our times is escape from personal responsibility for the consequences of one’s own behavior.
    - When people get used to preferential treatment, equal treatment seems like discrimination.
    - Too much of what is called 'education' is little more than an expensive isolation from reality.
    - The least productive people are usually the ones who are most in favor of holding meetings.
    - There are few talents more richly rewarded with both wealth and power, in countries around the world, than the ability to convince backward people that their problems are caused by other people who are more advanced.


- Feynman's technique for evaluating information, 
    - the first trick has to do with deciding whether someone else truly knows their stuff or is mimicking others
    - The second trick has to do with dealing with uncertainty
    - realization that as we investigate whether something is true or not, new evidence and new methods of experimentation should show the effect of getting stronger and stronger, not weaker. 
    - ask the right question, which is not “Could this be the case?” but “Is this actually the case?”
    - not using the same data that gave you the clue to make the conclusion.
    - Use proper statistical sampling to know whether or not we know what we are talking about 
    - Realize that many errors are due to lack of information 
    - Use Bayesian updating—starting with a priori odds, based on earlier understanding, and “updating” the odds of something based on what you learn thereafter.


- Geography - Geography plays important role in determining human life in the region. Mountainous regions are often less populated, economically backward and have sessionist tendencies. Mountains also contribute to what is called as "Rain Shadow" like in spain, where one side of the land remains dry because clouds usually empty on their way on the other side. Thus such regions make it hard for humans, goods and wealth to grow.22
