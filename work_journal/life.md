	- Food order - Order in which to eat food
		- Protein, fat and vegetables upfront 
		- Carbohydrates
	- Sugar is much worse than carbohydrates
	- Give your body a chance to digest food
	- Adding acid (Vinegar, Lemon juice, Fermented foods) to carbohydrates (e.g. Rice) results in less spike in blood glucose and insulin. It also increase satiaty. This is because it reduces glycemic index. 
	- Focus on foods and less on carbs etc.
	- Eat whole and unprocessed foods (in their natural form)
	- No Added sugars 

- Dr. Satchin Panda
	- Go to bed at consistent time and try to be in bed for 8 Hours so that you can get 7 hours of sleep.

	- Consistent time for breakfast and then finish eating within next Max. 10 hours
	- Try to be outdoor everyday for at least 30 minutes in daylight (even if cloudy)
	- Exercise daily. Afternoon physical activity is better than any other time also much better in reducing blood sugar.
	- 3 hours before sleep, 
		- No eating 
		- No bright lights
	- It takes 5 hours to digest food
	- After dinner, blood flows to stomach to absorb nutrients hence temp. is high. 
	- Morning meal - Simple sugars. Evening meal - Protein and fat that will help with fast till next day.
	- Dim lights 2-3 hours before sleep. e.g. use table lamps. Prefer orange or blue light.	
	- Try to eat within window of 10 (or less) hours in a day. However, allways be practical with your life (i.e. working , commuting time).

- David sinclair takeaways for healthy life 
    - Eat less often (Skip a meal), don't snack
    - avoid sugary drinks and food
    - reduce meat intake and opt for more plant based diet
    - choose the veggies that are stressed out 
    - Put the sugar at the end of the meal

- Health advice by Prof valter
    - Eat mostly vegan, plus a little fish, limiting meals with fish to a maximum of two or three per week. Choose fish, crustaceans, and mollusks with a high omega-3, omega-6, and vitamin B12 content (salmon, anchovies, sardines, cod, sea bream, trout, clams, shrimp.  Pay attention to the quality of the fish, choosing those with low levels of mercury.
	- If you are below the age of 65, keep protein intake low (0.31 to 0.36 grams per pound of body weight). That comes to 40 to 47 grams of proteins per day for a person weighing 130 pounds, and 60 to 70 grams of protein per day for someone weighing 200 to 220 pounds. Over age 65, you should slightly increase protein intake but also increase consumption of fish, eggs, white meat, and products derived from goats and sheep to preserve muscle mass. Consume beans, chickpeas, green peas, and other legumes as your main source of protein.
	- Minimize saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources (meat, cheese) and sugar, and maximize good fats and complex carbs. Eat whole grains and high quantities of vegetables (tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, legumes, etc.) with generous amounts of olive oil (3 tablespoons per day) and nuts (1 ounce per day).
	- Follow a diet with high vitamin and mineral content, supplemented with a multivitamin buffer every three days. 
	- Based on your weight, age, and abdominal circumference, decide whether to have two or three meals per day. If you are overweight or tend to gain weight easily, consume two meals a day: breakfast and either lunch or dinner, plus two low-sugar (less than 5 grams) snacks with fewer than 100 calories each. If you are already at a normal weight, or if you tend to lose weight easily or are over 65 and of normal weight, eat three meals a day and one low-sugar (less than 3 to 5 grams) snack with fewer than 100 calories.
	- Confine all eating to within a twelve-hour period; for example, start after 8 a.m. and end before 8 p.m. Don’t eat anything within three to four hours of bedtime.


- [Recommendations for Food intake][Health]
    - Liquid calories are not same as solid calories. Avoid liquid calories as body is not able to effectively apply measuring mechanism as it does with solid calories due to million years of evolution.
    - Things to check,
       - Eat as little as possible.(Eat less often)
        - Pay attention to fructose intake - eat less of super sweet fruits like mangoes and banana and more of less sweet fruits like Melons, guava. Get rid of fruit juices
        - Sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose - so consider using Glucon-D instead of white sugar Since it has 100% glucose
        - Honey and jaggery are mostly fructose. So eat less of it. Jaggery is 90% same as sugar. 
        - Starches are actually long chains of glucose.
    - More you feed gut bacteria , good it is. Shift diet to whole grains like red rice,Rajma. reduce maida,ata. Go large on portion of dal and small on rice. Switch to Millets
    - Use ghee.  Fat reduces rate at which blood sugar spikes
    - Getting body into ketosis (16 or more hours of fasting) is very beneficial
    - Veg people should pay attention to protein intake. Eat Dals. Consume dairy products.
    - Stop paying attention to carbohydrates and not fats.
    - Food is bad if coming out of packet. Be as close as you can of animal and plants you are eating. Closer our diets to what our great grand mothers ate, better it is.

- Health (Book: Why we get obese?) 
    - Obesity and overweight, so we’ll be told, are associated with an increased risk of virtually every chronic disease that ails us—heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, dementia, asthma.
    -  two factors will essentially determine how much fat we accumulate, both having to do with the hormone insulin. First, when insulin levels are elevated, we accumulate fat in our fat tissue; when these levels fall, we liberate fat from the fat tissue and burn it for fuel. This has been known since the early 1960s and has never been controversial. Second, our insulin levels are effectively determined by the carbohydrates we eat—not entirely, but for all intents and purposes. The more carbohydrates we eat, and the easier they are to digest and the sweeter they are, the more insulin we will ultimately secrete, meaning that the level of it in our bloodstream is greater and so is the fat we retain in our fat cells.
    - “Carbohydrate is driving insulin is driving fat"
    - the stimulation of insulin secretion caused by eating easily digestible, carbohydrate rich foods: refined carbohydrates, including flour and cereal grains, starchy vegetables such as potatoes, and sugars, like sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup. These carbohydrates literally make us fat, and by driving us to accumulate fat, they make us hungrier and they make us sedentary. 

    - FOODS THAT MUST BE EATEN EVERY DAY: 
        - Salad Greens: 2 cups a day.

        deviled eggs.
        - Insulin is the anabolic (building) hormone, and its primary job is to turn excess food into fat for future use. Insulin is a life-saving hormone without which humans wouldn’t have existed for a long time(Imagine storing food as abdominal fat and then giving energy until you find food). Now put this in perspective: eating every day, in fact, 3-4 times a day, insulin raises every time we eat, especially with refined carbohydrates, but it can also do protein and fat. Obesity rates are soaring all over the world(reason above). Insulin can be good and can also be equally harmful. Excess insulin leads to Diabetes, Inflammation, Atherosclerosis(Heart Disease), Obesity Etc

- Dr. Jamnadas on fasting
    - Ketosis - Fasting results in  lower Insulin levels which results in energy drawn from fats. Fats get converted to tryglcerides and fatty acids. These goto liver and converted to keytons.
    - Low carb, low sugar diet helps get into keto genesis much faster.
    - As long as insulin levels are high, one can not lose weight.
    - Autophagy is the body's way of cleaning out damaged cells, in order to regenerate newer, healthier cells.
    - High glycemic index fruits - Pineapple. Cherries. Mango. Papaya. Grapes. Kiwis. Watermelon. Cantaloupe.
    - Good, low glycemic index fruits - Berries, citrus fruits and Apples, peaches, plums and apricot, pears
    - Too much protein is troublesome. Increases risk of cancer. Taking protein powder is not a good idea. 
    - Tea , coffee without cream, sugar is ok during fasting 
    - No processed/refined food. No Sugar. Reduce Carbs. 

- Ashok Krish - Detested memorizing stuff. Exams are test of time than knowledge and analytical ability. Understand things from first principles, basic heuristics , models & metamodels. Avoid Hard manual labour, picks things that can be broken down and mastered. In terms of Indian cooking, tacit knowledge is no where captured. Health and nutrition is very complex subject.
    - Fats - they dont undergo any chemical changes till they reach intestine. Essentially replacement for Water at High temperature. 
    - Fats do not cause insulin spike 
    - Need certain amount of Fats.avoid trans-fats & refined oils. Always use refined oil for frying. 
    - Moderate ghee, butter are fine.
    - All spice flavours are fat soluble. Always spice add powders at the end and whole spices in fat i.e. Oil.
    - Carbohydrates, 
        - try to eat those has much fiber..Potatoes are better than grains.
    - Avoid direct sugars. 
    - Salt & Sugar sensors are at the tip of the tongue.
    - Avoid any liquid that has sugar in it. 
    - Cook vegetables and meat separately as both require different kind of heat. 
    - People tend to skeptical when it comes to food which is natural. 
    - Cooking generally has some degree of undoing like acid for bitter, dehydrate if soggy etc.
    - Restaurants exploit craving for salty, sweet and fatty tastes

- How to eat @ Restaurant 
    -	Choose a restaurant where the patrons aren’t smiling (because that means the regulars are here to eat, not socialize)
    -	When it comes to cuisines not native to the town you are in, choose a restaurant located on the outskirts of town rather than in the centre, it is more likely to have genuinely good food (lower rents, closer to recent immigrants into said town, both of which are likely to be good indicators of genuinely good food.)
    -	The weirder a dish sounds relative to the rest of the menu, the more likely it is to be worth ordering (for why else would the restaurant choose to include it in the menu in the first place)


- Food and Health
    - Potato is starch which gets converted into Glucose. Glucose is less damaging than fructose.
    - Sugar is 50-50% fructose and glucose. Glucose gets absorbed by Body, fructose can be processed only by Liver and gets converted to Fat.
    - For a healthy heart, keep ratio triglycerides to HDL should be 2 or less.
    - Avoid sugar, fructose, fine flour and vegetable oil
    - Human body is optimized for fasting and feasting 
    - Human body has enough vitamins and other nutrients for many days.
    - It’s the combination of sugar, fat, and salt that make foods ‘hyper-palatable’ and drives us to want and eat more
    - If you find you have certain foods that trigger you to overeat, don’t eat or keep these foods in the house. The more you decrease your exposure to these foods, the more likely you are to succeed with your diet. Studies suggest when people reduce the palatability of the diet, they’re more likely to succeed and keep the weight off in the long-term.
    - Serving foods with smaller plates may reduce the amount of food you eat and decrease calorie intake.
    - Don’t keep snacks around your desk while working. If you do want to grab a snack, make sure it’s kept in the office kitchen. The simple act of making it harder to get to will reduce the chances of mindless eating.
    - Pay attention. Don’t assume just because it’s called a salad, it’s zero-calorie and healthy. Most restaurants have the ingredients listed in the menu, check the salad to make sure there aren’t any extra toppings. If there are you can factor these into your calorie count for the day or simply ask the restaurant not add these when they make your food – remember, you’re paying them.


- How to get useful answers to your questions
    - ask yes/no questions
    - state your current understanding
    - be willing to interrupt
    - don’t accept responses that don’t answer your question
    - being good at extracting information is a superpower

- Food
    - Fermentation is the process by which microorganisms—bacteria, molds, yeasts—break down food and drink and by doing so preserve them and make them more delicious and nutritious. Some food and drink ferments beloved worldwide include cheese, leavened breads, cured meats, wine, soy sauce, miso, sauerkraut, and sour pickles.


- [How your organization works](https://copyconstruct.medium.com/know-how-your-org-works-or-how-to-become-a-more-effective-engineer-1a3287d1f58d)[Work]
    - Organizations usually reward those who "get the job done"
    - Necessary to understand skills that get rewarded 
    - Soft skills are hard skills
    - Understand implicit hierarchies 
    - Know the culture - Top-down or bottom-up

- First principles 
    - Process of Socratic questioning
        - Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?) 
        - Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) 
        - Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?) 
        - Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?) 
        - Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?) 
        - Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?) 
    
    - Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of history and conventional wisdom and see what is possible. When you really understand the principles at work, you can decide if the existing methods make sense. Often they don’t.  Many people mistakenly believe that creativity is something that only some of us are born with, and either we have it or we don’t. Fortunately, there seems to be ample evidence that this isn’t true. We’re all born rather creative, but during our formative years, it can be beaten out of us by busy parents and teachers. As adults, we rely on convention and what we’re told because that’s easier than breaking things down into first principles and thinking for yourself. Thinking through first principles is a way of taking off the blinders. Most things suddenly seem more possible. 

- Psychology 
    - Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice
    - What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences

- Charles' Rules of Argument  (https://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/03/21/charles_rules_of_argument)
    -  You will never change anyone's mind on a matter of opinion. People change their minds gradually, and if anything a prolonged argument only serves to back someone into a corner, huddling closer to the security blanket of what they believe. 
    - Never seek out things to disagree with. There are too many of them out there, and correcting the ills of the world just isn't your job.
    - If you come across something you disagree with while randomly browsing, let it pass without comment (see rule 1). If it's truly frustrating, write a reply, then delete it without sharing it with anyone else.
    - Even in the limited scope remaining, it is not your job to correct everything you find that you disagree with. Try to limit yourself to things where the subject is at least something that makes some practical difference to your life.
    - Do not argue about politics, religion, or matters of personal taste or comparative morality.
    - DO NOT argue with Lisp programmers, believers in the Semantic Web, or furries.
    - Saying something controversial in your own space (i.e. your weblog) is only arguing if you directly reference somebody you are disagreeing with (or it is clearly understood in subtext who you are disagreeing with), and that person is likely to give a shit about what you said.
    -  If someone disagrees with something you've said, you're already in an argument. 
    - Once you find yourself in an argument, your job is now to make your point clearly, and then leave.
        - State your case - Once you have stated your case, there's no point re-stating it.Going over the same ground repeatedly will damage your case.
        - Clarify any misunderstandings 
        - The ideal attitude to project during any argument is one of calm disinterest. 
        - Any emotional involvement you show is a weakness that can be exploited by your opponent.Even being passionate about your subject is dangerous, because over time passion becomes zeal, and zeal becomes shrillness.  

- Stoicism, 
    - Stoicism maintains that you should only focus on what YOU can control.  if you can't control it, there is no decision, and no virtue involved.And therefore it can neither make your life better nor worse.
    - Stoicism isn't about not needing friends, for example. It's about being able to bear the loss or lack of friends in the best way. It's about remaining self-fulfilled even after that love has ended, whether in heartbreak or grief.
    - Stoicism is unusually emphatic about action. To *do* is baked into the fabric of the Stoic philosophy.

- Work day,
    - Sit to do computer work. Sit using a height-adjustable, downward titling keyboard tray for the best work posture, then every 20 minutes stand for 8 minutes AND MOVE for 2 minutes. The absolute time isn’t critical but about every 20-30 minutes take a posture break and stand and move for a couple of minutes.  Simply standing is insufficient. Movement is important to get blood circulation through the muscles. And movement is FREE! Research shows that you don’t need to do vigorous exercise (e.g. jumping jacks) to get the benefits, just walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of creating greater movement variety in the workplace (e.g. walk to a printer, water fountain, stand for a meeting, take the stairs, walk around the floor, park a bit further away from the building each day).So the key is to build frequent movement variety into the normal workday

- In the absence of variety, bad ideas tend to stick around, which is also exactly what happens in closed societies and large corporations.
- Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available. The real world is often very boring. 
- People’s expectations rise faster than living standards, so a society that becomes exponentially wealthier can see a decline in net happiness and satisfaction. There is virtually nothing people can’t get accustomed to, which also helps explain why there is so much desire for innovation and improvement.


- Three rules of thumb
    - Anchoring rule - Use the first available piece of information as the basis for making an estimate about something that has absolutely nothing to do with that information.
    - Representative heuristics (or Rule of typical things) - choose intuition over logic. Belief about typicality. It 'generally favors outcomes that make good
    stories or good hypotheses. It is particularly good for learning from the very worst sort of experiences.

- Leadership
    - Watching video games is like living other people's life.
    - Living in the past is like living someone else's life.
    - It is good to try achieve things but dont get fixated with outcome.
    - We are here to make positive difference in life and not being smart or right
    - Make peace with decision who has power to make it 
    - Questions 
        - Did i do my best to, 
            - set clear goals
            - progress towards achieving my goal
            - be happy
            - build positive relationships


- Religions
    - Churches thrive on obsession. Obsessed believers become missionaries, preachers, and evangelists. Obsession is a feature, not a flaw, of religion.
    - Nothing is more persuasive than the opinion you desperately want to believe is true.
    - Religion is a core component of identity for billions of people. Religion provides structure, a moral compass, and a sense of right and wrong. Religion gives us a sense of purpose. The belief in a higher power, whether it be God, Allah, or Yahweh, shelters us against the fear of death and the infinite unknown.
    - "I never desire to converse with a man who has written more than he has read."

- Thomas Sowell's Quotes
    - Intellect is not wisdom
    - When you want to help people, you tell them the truth. When you want to help yourself, you tell them what they want to hear.
    - People who pride themselves on their "complexity" and deride others for being "simplistic" should realize that the truth is often not very complicated.What gets complex is evading the truth.
    - Bailing out people who made ill-advised mortgages makes no more sense than bailing out people who lost their life savings in Las Vegas casinos.
    - The problem isn't that Johnny can't read. The problem isn't even that Johnny can't think.The problem is that Johnny doesn't know what thinking is. He confuses it with feeling.
    - It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance.
    - There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.
    - Despite a voluminous and often fervent literature on "income distribution," the cold fact is that most income is not distributed: It is earned.
    - The great escape of our times is escape from personal responsibility for the consequences of one’s own behavior.
    - When people get used to preferential treatment, equal treatment seems like discrimination.
    - Too much of what is called 'education' is little more than an expensive isolation from reality.
    - The least productive people are usually the ones who are most in favor of holding meetings.
    - There are few talents more richly rewarded with both wealth and power, in countries around the world, than the ability to convince backward people that their problems are caused by other people who are more advanced.

- If I spend somebody else’s money on somebody else, I’m not concerned about how much it is, and I’m not concerned about what I get. And that’s government.


- Feynman's technique for evaluating information, 
    - the first trick has to do with deciding whether someone else truly knows their stuff or is mimicking others
    - The second trick has to do with dealing with uncertainty
    - realization that as we investigate whether something is true or not, new evidence and new methods of experimentation should show the effect of getting stronger and stronger, not weaker. 
    - ask the right question, which is not “Could this be the case?” but “Is this actually the case?”
    - not using the same data that gave you the clue to make the conclusion.
    - Use proper statistical sampling to know whether or not we know what we are talking about 
    - Realize that many errors are due to lack of information 
    - Use Bayesian updating—starting with a priori odds, based on earlier understanding, and “updating” the odds of something based on what you learn thereafter.

    - The inability to forecast the past has no impact on our desire to forecast the future
    - No one’s success is proven until they’ve survived a calamity.
    - It takes less effort to increase confidence than it does ability.
    - Incentives are the strongest force in the world. 
    - Sitting still feels reckless in a fast-moving world, even in situations where it offers the best odds of long-term compounding.
    - It’s hard to determine what is dumb luck and what is unfortunate risk.
    - Calm plants the seeds of crazy
    - Stories are more powerful than statistics, because they’re easier to understand and contextualize to your own life. 
    - Most people are blind to their own faults.


- Geography - Geography plays important role in determining human life in the region. Mountainous regions are often less populated, economically backward and have sessionist tendencies. Mountains also contribute to what is called as "Rain Shadow" like in spain, where one side of the land remains dry because clouds usually empty on their way on the other side. Thus such regions make it hard for humans, goods and wealth to grow.

    - Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.You retire by saving up enough money, becoming a monk, or by finding work that feels like play to you.


- Solitude and leadership
	- In bureaucratic environments, what is rewarded above all is conformity, some one who keeps routine going.
    - Need of the hour is People who know how to do more than follow orders and execute routines.
	- Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it.Not learning other people’s ideas, or memorizing a body of information, however much those may sometimes be useful. Developing your own ideas. In short, thinking for yourself. first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. It’s only by concentrating, sticking to the question, being patient, letting all the parts of my mind come into play, that I arrive at an original idea. By giving my brain a chance to make associations, draw connections, take me by surprise. And often even that idea doesn’t turn out to be very good. I need time to think about it, too, to make mistakes and recognize them, to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing
	- You do your best thinking by slowing down and concentrating.

- Wisdom from Charlie Munger

	- extremely intense ideology should be avoided because it cabbages up one’s mind.
	- I’m not entitled to have an opinion on this subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people do who are supporting it.
	- there is no love that’s so right as admiration-based love
	- Wisdom acquisition is a moral duty.
	- envy, resentment, revenge, and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought. Self-pity gets pretty close to paranoia and paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse.
	- inversion will help you solve problems that you can't solve in other ways.
	- avoid working directly under somebody you really don't admire and don't want to be like	
	- you want to get out of yourself: thinking that what’s good for you is good for the wider civilization and rationalizing all these ridiculous conclusions based on the subconscious tendency to serve one’s self. 
	- If you want to persuade, appeal to interest not to reason - Ben franklin
	- planck knowledge - the people who really know. Chauffer knowledge - shallow knowledge.
	- anticipate trouble all the time and be ready to perform adequately if trouble came


- Life
	- Like oxygen, we ignore time when it's abundant, but we desperately want more as it becomes scarce.
	- But compound interest isn't solely reserved for finance. In fact, its most valuable application is in your health.
	-"A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one."
	- Health's greatest value is the optionality it gives you.
	- Every other form of wealth is irrelevant if you have a scarcity of relationships. 
	- Money is an infinite resource, but experiences, like time, are finite.

- Principles to note when disagreeing with someone who is more powerful than you, 
    - Do:
        •	Explain that you have a different opinion and ask if you can voice it.
        •	Restate the original point of view or decision so it’s clear you understand it.
        •	Speak slowly — talking in an even tone calms you and the other person down.
    - Don’t:
        •	Assume that disagreeing is going to damage your relationship or career — the consequences are often less dramatic than we think.
        •	State your opinions as facts; simply express your point of view and be open to dialogue.
        •	Use judgment words, such as “hasty,” “foolish,” or “wrong,” that might upset or incite your counterpart.

- Rules for following Circadian rhythm of Body, 
	- No food for at least 2 hours after waking up
	- Try to have meals within 10 hours in a day 
	- Stop eating at least 2 hours before sleep
	- Try to be in bed for at least 8 hours

- Public Key infrastructure, 
    -   Uses signature (A message authentication code (MAC) is a bit of data that’s used to verify which entity sent a message, and to ensure that a message hasn’t been modified.) based on Shared secret. Signature can be verified by public key but can only be generated using corresponding private key. 
    - Based on public key cryptography (a.k.a. Asymmetric cryptography)
        - public key that can be distributed 
        - private key which is kept confidential by server
    - You can encrypt some data with the public key. The only way to decrypt that data is with the corresponding private key.
    - You can sign some data with the private key. Anyone who knows the corresponding public key can verify the signature, proving which private key produced it.    
    - A certificate is a data structure that contains a public key and a name. The data structure is then signed. The signature binds the public key to the name
    -  The entity that signs a certificate is called the issuer (or certificate authority) and the entity named in the certificate is called the subject.

- Economics
    - Most basic economic principle is less is demanded at higher price than at a lower price.
	- Knowledge is never perfect and the longer the time between decision and its consequences the wider the gray area of uncertainty. One of the ways of dealing with this uncertainty is to prepare alternate courses of action.
	- Those businesses which come closest to the optimal size of inventory will have their profit prospects enhanced.
	- Investment is a way of transferring resources to where they have alternate uses that are more valuable than where they are.
	- In case of physical quantities of natural resources, economic concepts of cost, prices and present values must be considered if practical conclusions are to be reached. Any amount of natural resources will count for little without considering costs for extraction and processing.
	- The real cost of anything is still its value in alternative usage. e.g. The real cost of building a bridge are the other things that could have been built with same labor and material.
	- The nirvana fallacy is the informal fallacy of comparing actual things with unrealistic, idealized alternatives. comparing imperfect market solution to a government solution. 
	- politics reduces cost of irrationality
	- In price-coordinated economy, nobody needs to know specifics of all the things. 
    - A price artificially raised tends to cause more to be supplied and less to be demanded than when prices are left to be determined in a free market.
	- The crucial requirement for maintaining growth and progress is that successful experiments be continued and unsuccessful experiments be terminated.
     - What is important is not the success or failure of particular individuals or companies, but the success of particular knowledge and insights in prevailing despite the blindness or resistance of others. Given the scarcity of such resources, an economy in which they have decisive advantages is an economy which itself has greater advantages in creating higher standards of living. A Society that taps all kinds of talents from all kind of resources has advantage.No economic system can depend on the continuing wisdom of select few (Existing leaders). Economic pressures (Competition @ Marketplace, irrate stackholders etc.) can force leaders to change course. Hence economies under the thumb of commisars have seldom matched track record of capitalist economies. 
	- The difference between limited knowledge of business executive from government official is that he is received instructions from others on what to do while government official is giving instructions to others and compelling them to obey. 
	- The very thing that makes a modern industrial society so efficient and so effective in raising living standards 
    - the constant quest for newer and better ways of getting work done and more goods produced
    - also makes it impossible to keep on doing things the same old familiar ways with same workers doing same job.
    - What people will bid for bonds depends on how much they could get for the same money by putting it somewhere else. That is why bond prices go down when interest rate goes up and vice-versa. A Bond with 105 a year from now is not worth buying for 100 today if the current interest rate is 6 percent.
	- For a period of year, bonds are likely to be much safer than stocks. For a period of 20 or 30 years, the risk of inflation threatens the value of bonds or other assets with fixed amounts.Even in the absense of inflation, stock prices can generally be relied on to rise over a period of decades while bond prices and the prices of other fixed assets do not. 
	- "It is wrong for people to be penalized for things that are not their fault" - This implicitly changes subject from risk to morality.
	- Politics and economics differ radilly in a way they deal with time. 
	- In economics, future consequences are anticipated in concept of "present value". 
	- In the context of National Economy, Avoid "Fallacy of composition" - What applies to part applies to the whole. 
	- GDP - sum total of everything produced within a nation's borders. Over the period of generations, the goods and services which constitute national output change so much that statistical comparisons become practically meaningless.
	- Rare (or in limited supply) metals like Gold, silver were chosen so as to deprive those in powers from expanding money supply which triggers inflation.
	- As tax rates reach higher levels, particular economic activities may be abandoned by those who do not find the net rate of return on these activities, after taxes, to be enough to justify efforts.
	- Inflation is in effect hidden tax. The money that people have saved is robbed of part of its purchasing power, which is quietly transferred to the government that issues new money.
	- By setting interest rate on the money it lends to the banks, central banks indirectly control the interest rate that banks will charge general public. 
	- The most basic function of government is to provide a framework of law and order, within which the people are free to engage in whatever economic and other activities they choose. Some other functions are, 
		- Military defence 
		- Setting standards
	- Specific knowledge is far more important than general expertise. 

- Negotiations 
	- Leverage: Preparation is vital. Leverage comes from knowing what they need. The person that is more comfortable with “no deal” usually has more leverage.
	- Goals: Make them specific and aim high. Use recognized third-party sources or the other side’s previous deals. This will give you confidence and reduce fear.
	- Negotiate Process: Make sure they have the authority to say yes. Establish that information exchange is not binding. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”
	- Establish and Maintain Trust: If you tell me a drought is coming and my first instinct is to buy a canoe, I’m walking away. Lack of trust can kill even the best deals.
	- Information Exchange: Listening = more leverage. Don’t go zero-sum; expand the pie and create value.
	- Offers: If you don’t have good information, let them make the first offer. If you have good information, go first. Ask for the most you can justify. Don’t be too reasonable at first — most people expect a back and forth.
	- Concessions: Link them with “if…then.” Make sure they recognize you’re giving up something of value so they feel the need to reciprocate.
	- When Things Break Down: Don’t make ultimatums if you don’t have to. Ignore their ultimatums. If it gets ugly, involve a third party.
	- Closing And Commitment: You want them to feel happy. This creates follow through and better subsequent negotiations.
    - Principled negotiation techniques
        - Separate people from the problem
        - Focus on interests not positions 
        - Generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do
        - Insist that results be based on some objective standard (like market value, expert opinion, custom or law)
