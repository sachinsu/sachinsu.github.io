- Dr. Jason fung 
	- Food order - Order in which to eat food
		- Protein, fat and vegetables upfront 
		- Carbohydrates
	- Sugar is much worse than carbohydrates
	- Give your body a chance to digest food
	- Adding acid (Vinegar, Lemon juice, Fermented foods) to carbohydrates (e.g. Rice) results in less spike in blood glucose and insulin. It also increase satiety. This is because it reduces glycemic index. 
	- Focus on foods and less on carbs etc.
	- Eat whole and unprocessed foods (in their natural form)
	- No Added sugars 

- Dr. Satchin Panda
	- Go to bed at consistent time and try to be in bed for 8 Hours so that you can get 7 hours of sleep.
	- In Morning, wait for at least 1 hour before eating.
	- Consistent time for breakfast and then finish eating within next Max. 10 hours
	- Try to be outdoor everyday for at least 30 minutes in daylight (even if cloudy)
	- Exercise daily. Afternoon physical activity is better than any other time also much better in reducing blood sugar.
	- 3 hours before sleep, 
		- No eating 
		- No bright lights
	- It takes 5 hours to digest food
	- After dinner, blood flows to stomach to absorb nutrients hence temp. is high. 
	- Morning meal - Simple sugars. Evening meal - Protein and fat that will help with fast till next day.
	- Dim lights 2-3 hours before sleep. e.g. use table lamps. Prefer orange or blue light.	
	- Try to eat within window of 10 (or less) hours in a day. However, always be practical with your life (i.e. working , commuting time).
	- Retina has protein named melanin which helps even blind people sense light.
	- Avoiding Jet lag - By resetting the body clock. 
		- No food in flight. 
		- Depending on the flight time, Finish last meal before boarding flight or try to adhere to usual fasting timeline. 
		- don't get light exposure in flight. Don't read much but get sleep.
	- Shift work - Do not eat during shift work. 
	- Humans are designed to take nap after lunch. We are active in morning and early evening. 

- David sinclair takeaways for healthy life 
    - Eat less often (Skip a meal), don't snack
    - avoid sugary drinks and food
    - reduce meat intake and opt for more plant based diet
    - choose the veggies that are stressed out 
    - Put the sugar at the end of the meal

- Health advice by Prof walter
    - Eat mostly vegan, plus a little fish, limiting meals with fish to a maximum of two or three per week. Choose fish, crustaceans, and mollusks with a high omega-3, omega-6, and vitamin B12 content (salmon, anchovies, sardines, cod, sea bream, trout, clams, shrimp.  Pay attention to the quality of the fish, choosing those with low levels of mercury.
	- If you are below the age of 65, keep protein intake low (0.31 to 0.36 grams per pound of body weight). That comes to 40 to 47 grams of proteins per day for a person weighing 130 pounds, and 60 to 70 grams of protein per day for someone weighing 200 to 220 pounds. Over age 65, you should slightly increase protein intake but also increase consumption of fish, eggs, white meat, and products derived from goats and sheep to preserve muscle mass. Consume beans, chickpeas, green peas, and other legumes as your main source of protein.
	- Minimize saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources (meat, cheese) and sugar, and maximize good fats and complex carbs. Eat whole grains and high quantities of vegetables (tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, legumes, etc.) with generous amounts of olive oil (3 tablespoons per day) and nuts (1 ounce per day).
	- Follow a diet with high vitamin and mineral content, supplemented with a multivitamin buffer every three days. 
	- Based on your weight, age, and abdominal circumference, decide whether to have two or three meals per day. If you are overweight or tend to gain weight easily, consume two meals a day: breakfast and either lunch or dinner, plus two low-sugar (less than 5 grams) snacks with fewer than 100 calories each. If you are already at a normal weight, or if you tend to lose weight easily or are over 65 and of normal weight, eat three meals a day and one low-sugar (less than 3 to 5 grams) snack with fewer than 100 calories.
	- Confine all eating to within a twelve-hour period; for example, start after 8 a.m. and end before 8 p.m. Don’t eat anything within three to four hours of bedtime.


- [Recommendations for Food intake][Health]
    - Liquid calories are not same as solid calories. Avoid liquid calories as body is not able to effectively apply measuring mechanism as it does with solid calories due to million years of evolution.
    - Things to check,
       - Eat as little as possible.(Eat less often)
        - Pay attention to fructose intake - eat less of super sweet fruits like mangoes and banana and more of less sweet fruits like Melons, guava. Get rid of fruit juices
        - Sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose - so consider using Glucon-D instead of white sugar Since it has 100% glucose
        - Honey and jaggery are mostly fructose. So eat less of it. Jaggery is 90% same as sugar. 
        - Starches are actually long chains of glucose.
    - More you feed gut bacteria , good it is. Shift diet to whole grains like red rice,Rajma. reduce maida,ata. Go large on portion of dal and small on rice. Switch to Millets
    - Use ghee.  Fat reduces rate at which blood sugar spikes
    - Getting body into ketosis (16 or more hours of fasting) is very beneficial
    - Veg people should pay attention to protein intake. Eat Dals. Consume dairy products.
    - Stop paying attention to carbohydrates and not fats.
    - Food is bad if coming out of packet. Be as close as you can of animal and plants you are eating. Closer our diets to what our great grand mothers ate, better it is.

- Health (Book: Why we get obese?) 
    - Obesity and overweight, so we’ll be told, are associated with an increased risk of virtually every chronic disease that ails us—heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, dementia, asthma.
    -  two factors will essentially determine how much fat we accumulate, both having to do with the hormone insulin. First, when insulin levels are elevated, we accumulate fat in our fat tissue; when these levels fall, we liberate fat from the fat tissue and burn it for fuel. This has been known since the early 1960s and has never been controversial. Second, our insulin levels are effectively determined by the carbohydrates we eat—not entirely, but for all intents and purposes. The more carbohydrates we eat, and the easier they are to digest and the sweeter they are, the more insulin we will ultimately secrete, meaning that the level of it in our bloodstream is greater and so is the fat we retain in our fat cells.
    - “Carbohydrate is driving insulin is driving fat"
    - the stimulation of insulin secretion caused by eating easily digestible, carbohydrate rich foods: refined carbohydrates, including flour and cereal grains, starchy vegetables such as potatoes, and sugars, like sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup. These carbohydrates literally make us fat, and by driving us to accumulate fat, they make us hungrier and they make us sedentary. 

    - FOODS THAT MUST BE EATEN EVERY DAY: 
        - Salad Greens: 2 cups a day.

        - Snacks: Pork rinds/skins; pepperoni slices; ham, beef, turkey, and other meat roll-ups;
        deviled eggs.
        - Insulin is the anabolic (building) hormone, and its primary job is to turn excess food into fat for future use. Insulin is a life-saving hormone without which humans wouldn’t have existed for a long time(Imagine storing food as abdominal fat and then giving energy until you find food). Now put this in perspective: eating every day, in fact, 3-4 times a day, insulin raises every time we eat, especially with refined carbohydrates, but it can also do protein and fat. Obesity rates are soaring all over the world(reason above). Insulin can be good and can also be equally harmful. Excess insulin leads to Diabetes, Inflammation, Atherosclerosis(Heart Disease), Obesity Etc

- Dr. Jamnadas on fasting
    - Ketosis - Fasting results in  lower Insulin levels which results in energy drawn from fats. Fats get converted to tryglcerides and fatty acids. These goto liver and converted to keytons.
    - Low carb, low sugar diet helps get into keto genesis much faster.
    - As long as insulin levels are high, one can not lose weight.
    - Autophagy is the body's way of cleaning out damaged cells, in order to regenerate newer, healthier cells.
    - High glycemic index fruits - Pineapple. Cherries. Mango. Papaya. Grapes. Kiwis. Watermelon. Cantaloupe.
    - Good, low glycemic index fruits - Berries, citrus fruits and Apples, peaches, plums and apricot, pears
    - Too much protein is troublesome. Increases risk of cancer. Taking protein powder is not a good idea. 
    - Tea , coffee without cream, sugar is ok during fasting 
    - No processed/refined food. No Sugar. Reduce Carbs. 

- Ashok Krish - Detested memorizing stuff. Exams are test of time than knowledge and analytical ability. Understand things from first principles, basic heuristics , models & meta models. Avoid Hard manual labour, picks things that can be broken down and mastered. In terms of Indian cooking, tacit knowledge is no where captured. Health and nutrition is very complex subject.
    - Fats - they dont undergo any chemical changes till they reach intestine. Essentially replacement for Water at High temperature. 
    - Fats do not cause insulin spike 
    - Need certain amount of Fats.avoid trans-fats & refined oils. Always use refined oil for frying. 
    - Moderate ghee, butter are fine.
    - All spice flavours are fat soluble. Always spice add powders at the end and whole spices in fat i.e. Oil.
    - Carbohydrates, 
        - try to eat those has much fiber..Potatoes are better than grains.
    - Avoid direct sugars. 
    - Salt & Sugar sensors are at the tip of the tongue.
    - Avoid any liquid that has sugar in it. 
    - Cook vegetables and meat separately as both require different kind of heat. 
    - People tend to skeptical when it comes to food which is natural. 
    - Cooking generally has some degree of undoing like acid for bitter, dehydrate if soggy etc.
    - Restaurants exploit craving for salty, sweet and fatty tastes
    - How to eat @ Restaurant 
        - Eat street food which is deep fried/hot/salty/saur and bacteria/fungi do not like these conditions 
        -	Choose a restaurant where the patrons aren’t smiling (because that means the regulars are here to eat, not socialize). Always find restaurants where locals go to.
        - Ignore negative comments when choosing restaurant (Internet incentivize negative comments)
        -	When it comes to cuisines not native to the town you are in, choose a restaurant located on the outskirts of town rather than in the centre, it is more likely to have genuinely good food (lower rents, closer to recent immigrants into said town, both of which are likely to be good indicators of genuinely good food.)
        -	The weirder a dish sounds relative to the rest of the menu, the more likely it is to be worth ordering (for why else would the restaurant choose to include it in the menu in the first place)
    - Cooking
        - All vegetables have defensive mechanisms when attacked (i.e. peeled/cut).
        - Pinch of baking soda to palak helps retain green color while cooking 
        - Potato/brinjal are soaked in water to avoid them browning.
        - Coconut is only plant based saturated fat.
        - For indian cooking, stainless steel (and cast iron) are preferred because use of savouring agents (tamarind etc.) tend to react with Metal and it gets mixed with food.
        - To get restaurant like texture, brown vegetables separately than gravy. 
        - Adding some fat (e.g. oil) to legumes will avoid froth while boiling them.
        - Plants adopt defensive action when peeled/cooked etc. and they release chemicals which gives distinct aroma.
        - Heating spices unlocks flavour oils which is then used in oil for frying
        - Salt and sugar amplify flavours
        - Store spices, legumes in refrigerator.



- Food and Health
    - Potato is starch which gets converted into Glucose. Glucose is less damaging than fructose.
    - Sugar is 50-50% fructose and glucose. Glucose gets absorbed by Body, fructose can be processed only by Liver and gets converted to Fat.
    - For a healthy heart, keep ratio triglycerides to HDL should be 2 or less.
    - Avoid sugar, fructose, fine flour and vegetable oil
    - Human body is optimized for fasting and feasting 
    - Human body has enough vitamins and other nutrients for many days.
    - It’s the combination of sugar, fat, and salt that make foods ‘hyper-palatable’ and drives us to want and eat more
    - If you find you have certain foods that trigger you to overeat, don’t eat or keep these foods in the house. The more you decrease your exposure to these foods, the more likely you are to succeed with your diet. Studies suggest when people reduce the palatability of the diet, they’re more likely to succeed and keep the weight off in the long-term.
    - Serving foods with smaller plates may reduce the amount of food you eat and decrease calorie intake.
    - Don’t keep snacks around your desk while working. If you do want to grab a snack, make sure it’s kept in the office kitchen. The simple act of making it harder to get to will reduce the chances of mindless eating.
    - Pay attention. Don’t assume just because it’s called a salad, it’s zero-calorie and healthy. Most restaurants have the ingredients listed in the menu, check the salad to make sure there aren’t any extra toppings. If there are you can factor these into your calorie count for the day or simply ask the restaurant not add these when they make your food – remember, you’re paying them.

    - being good at extracting information is a superpower

- Food
    - Fermentation is the process by which microorganisms—bacteria, molds, yeasts—break down food and drink and by doing so preserve them and make them more delicious and nutritious. Some food and drink ferments beloved worldwide include cheese, leavened breads, cured meats, wine, soy sauce, miso, sauerkraut, and sour pickles.

- First principles 
    - Process of Socratic questioning
        - Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?) 
        - Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) 
        - Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?) 
        - Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?) 
        - Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?) 
        - Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?) 
    
    - Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of history and conventional wisdom and see what is possible. When you really understand the principles at work, you can decide if the existing methods make sense. Often they don’t.  Many people mistakenly believe that creativity is something that only some of us are born with, and either we have it or we don’t. Fortunately, there seems to be ample evidence that this isn’t true. We’re all born rather creative, but during our formative years, it can be beaten out of us by busy parents and teachers. As adults, we rely on convention and what we’re told because that’s easier than breaking things down into first principles and thinking for yourself. Thinking through first principles is a way of taking off the blinders. Most things suddenly seem more possible. 

- Psychology 
    - Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice
    - What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences

- Charles' Rules of Argument  (https://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/03/21/charles_rules_of_argument)
    -  You will never change anyone's mind on a matter of opinion. People change their minds gradually, and if anything a prolonged argument only serves to back someone into a corner, huddling closer to the security blanket of what they believe. 
    - Never seek out things to disagree with. There are too many of them out there, and correcting the ills of the world just isn't your job.
    - If you come across something you disagree with while randomly browsing, let it pass without comment (see rule 1). If it's truly frustrating, write a reply, then delete it without sharing it with anyone else.
    - Even in the limited scope remaining, it is not your job to correct everything you find that you disagree with. Try to limit yourself to things where the subject is at least something that makes some practical difference to your life.
    - Do not argue about politics, religion, or matters of personal taste or comparative morality.
    - DO NOT argue with Lisp programmers, believers in the Semantic Web, or furries.
    - Saying something controversial in your own space (i.e. your weblog) is only arguing if you directly reference somebody you are disagreeing with (or it is clearly understood in subtext who you are disagreeing with), and that person is likely to give a shit about what you said.
    -  If someone disagrees with something you've said, you're already in an argument. 
    - Once you find yourself in an argument, your job is now to make your point clearly, and then leave.
        - State your case - Once you have stated your case, there's no point re-stating it.Going over the same ground repeatedly will damage your case.
        - Clarify any misunderstandings 
        - The ideal attitude to project during any argument is one of calm disinterest. 
        - Any emotional involvement you show is a weakness that can be exploited by your opponent.Even being passionate about your subject is dangerous, because over time passion becomes zeal, and zeal becomes shrillness.  

- Stoicism, 
    - Stoicism maintains that you should only focus on what YOU can control.  if you can't control it, there is no decision, and no virtue involved.And therefore it can neither make your life better nor worse.
    - Stoicism isn't about not needing friends, for example. It's about being able to bear the loss or lack of friends in the best way. It's about remaining self-fulfilled even after that love has ended, whether in heartbreak or grief.
    - Stoicism is unusually emphatic about action. To *do* is baked into the fabric of the Stoic philosophy.

- Work day,
    - Sit to do computer work. Sit using a height-adjustable, downward titling keyboard tray for the best work posture, then every 20 minutes stand for 8 minutes AND MOVE for 2 minutes. The absolute time isn’t critical but about every 20-30 minutes take a posture break and stand and move for a couple of minutes.  Simply standing is insufficient. Movement is important to get blood circulation through the muscles. And movement is FREE! Research shows that you don’t need to do vigorous exercise (e.g. jumping jacks) to get the benefits, just walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of creating greater movement variety in the workplace (e.g. walk to a printer, water fountain, stand for a meeting, take the stairs, walk around the floor, park a bit further away from the building each day).So the key is to build frequent movement variety into the normal workday

- In the absence of variety, bad ideas tend to stick around, which is also exactly what happens in closed societies and large corporations.
- Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available. The real world is often very boring. 
- People’s expectations rise faster than living standards, so a society that becomes exponentially wealthier can see a decline in net happiness and satisfaction. There is virtually nothing people can’t get accustomed to, which also helps explain why there is so much desire for innovation and improvement.


- Three rules of thumb
    - Anchoring rule - Use the first available piece of information as the basis for making an estimate about something that has absolutely nothing to do with that information.
    - Representative heuristics (or Rule of typical things) - choose intuition over logic. Belief about typicality. It 'generally favors outcomes that make good
    stories or good hypotheses. It is particularly good for learning from the very worst sort of experiences.

- Leadership
    - Watching video games is like living other people's life.
    - Living in the past is like living someone else's life.
    - It is good to try achieve things but dont get fixated with outcome.
    - We are here to make positive difference in life and not being smart or right
    - Make peace with decision who has power to make it 
    - Questions 
        - Did i do my best to, 
            - set clear goals
            - progress towards achieving my goal
            - be happy
            - build positive relationships


- Religions
    - Churches thrive on obsession. Obsessed believers become missionaries, preachers, and evangelists. Obsession is a feature, not a flaw, of religion.
    - Nothing is more persuasive than the opinion you desperately want to believe is true.
    - Religion is a core component of identity for billions of people. Religion provides structure, a moral compass, and a sense of right and wrong. Religion gives us a sense of purpose. The belief in a higher power, whether it be God, Allah, or Yahweh, shelters us against the fear of death and the infinite unknown.
    - "I never desire to converse with a man who has written more than he has read."

- Thomas Sowell's Quotes
    - Intellect is not wisdom
    - When you want to help people, you tell them the truth. When you want to help yourself, you tell them what they want to hear.
    - People who pride themselves on their "complexity" and deride others for being "simplistic" should realize that the truth is often not very complicated.What gets complex is evading the truth.
    - Bailing out people who made ill-advised mortgages makes no more sense than bailing out people who lost their life savings in Las Vegas casinos.
    - The problem isn't that Johnny can't read. The problem isn't even that Johnny can't think.The problem is that Johnny doesn't know what thinking is. He confuses it with feeling.
    - It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance.
    - There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.
    - Despite a voluminous and often fervent literature on "income distribution," the cold fact is that most income is not distributed: It is earned.
    - The great escape of our times is escape from personal responsibility for the consequences of one’s own behavior.
    - When people get used to preferential treatment, equal treatment seems like discrimination.
    - Too much of what is called 'education' is little more than an expensive isolation from reality.
    - The least productive people are usually the ones who are most in favor of holding meetings.
    - There are few talents more richly rewarded with both wealth and power, in countries around the world, than the ability to convince backward people that their problems are caused by other people who are more advanced.

    - Great leadership requires eternal vigilance

- If I spend somebody else’s money on somebody else, I’m not concerned about how much it is, and I’m not concerned about what I get. And that’s government.


- Feynman's technique for evaluating information, 
    - the first trick has to do with deciding whether someone else truly knows their stuff or is mimicking others
    - The second trick has to do with dealing with uncertainty
    - realization that as we investigate whether something is true or not, new evidence and new methods of experimentation should show the effect of getting stronger and stronger, not weaker. 
    - ask the right question, which is not “Could this be the case?” but “Is this actually the case?”
    - not using the same data that gave you the clue to make the conclusion.
    - Use proper statistical sampling to know whether or not we know what we are talking about 
    - Realize that many errors are due to lack of information 
    - Use Bayesian updating—starting with a priori odds, based on earlier understanding, and “updating” the odds of something based on what you learn thereafter.


- Big beliefs,
    - The inability to forecast the past has no impact on our desire to forecast the future
    - No one’s success is proven until they’ve survived a calamity.
    - It takes less effort to increase confidence than it does ability.
    - Incentives are the strongest force in the world. 
    - Sitting still feels reckless in a fast-moving world, even in situations where it offers the best odds of long-term compounding.
    - It’s hard to determine what is dumb luck and what is unfortunate risk.
    - Calm plants the seeds of crazy
    - Stories are more powerful than statistics, because they’re easier to understand and contextualize to your own life. 
    - Most people are blind to their own faults.


- Geography - Geography plays important role in determining human life in the region. Mountainous regions are often less populated, economically backward and have sessionist tendencies. Mountains also contribute to what is called as "Rain Shadow" like in spain, where one side of the land remains dry because clouds usually empty on their way on the other side. Thus such regions make it hard for humans, goods and wealth to grow.

    - Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now.
    - It’s the mark of a charlatan to try and explain simple things in complex ways and it’s the mark of a genius to explain complicated things in simple ways.
    - Mute the nitpickers, block the outraged, like the kind,follow the insightful
    - The modern world is managed by bureaucracies staffed with average people. Bureaucrats pile on rule after rule to keep the below-average from hurting themselves or others. Smart & capable individuals need to either opt-out of society or win big before the system suffocates them.
    - Smart money is just dumb money that’s been through a crash
    - People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom.
    - Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.You retire by saving up enough money, becoming a monk, or by finding work that feels like play to you.


- Solitude and leadership
	- In bureaucratic environments, what is rewarded above all is conformity, some one who keeps routine going.
    - Need of the hour is People who know how to do more than follow orders and execute routines.
	- Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it.Not learning other people’s ideas, or memorizing a body of information, however much those may sometimes be useful. Developing your own ideas. In short, thinking for yourself. first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. It’s only by concentrating, sticking to the question, being patient, letting all the parts of my mind come into play, that I arrive at an original idea. By giving my brain a chance to make associations, draw connections, take me by surprise. And often even that idea doesn’t turn out to be very good. I need time to think about it, too, to make mistakes and recognize them, to make false starts and correct them, to outlast my impulses, to defeat my desire to declare the job done and move on to the next thing
	- You do your best thinking by slowing down and concentrating.

- Wisdom from Charlie Munger
	- safest way to try and get what you want is to try and deserve what you want
	- A man who doesn’t know what happened before he was born goes through life like a child.
	- extremely intense ideology should be avoided because it cabbages up one’s mind.
	- I’m not entitled to have an opinion on this subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people do who are supporting it.
	- there is no love that’s so right as admiration-based love
	- Wisdom acquisition is a moral duty.
	- envy, resentment, revenge, and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought. Self-pity gets pretty close to paranoia and paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse.
	- inversion will help you solve problems that you can't solve in other ways.
	- avoid working directly under somebody you really don't admire and don't want to be like	
	- you want to get out of yourself: thinking that what’s good for you is good for the wider civilization and rationalizing all these ridiculous conclusions based on the subconscious tendency to serve one’s self. 
	- If you want to persuade, appeal to interest not to reason - Ben franklin
	- planck knowledge - the people who really know. Chauffer knowledge - shallow knowledge.
	- anticipate trouble all the time and be ready to perform adequately if trouble came


- Life
	- Like oxygen, we ignore time when it's abundant, but we desperately want more as it becomes scarce.
	- But compound interest isn't solely reserved for finance. In fact, its most valuable application is in your health.
	-"A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one."
	- Health's greatest value is the optionality it gives you.
	- Every other form of wealth is irrelevant if you have a scarcity of relationships. 
	- Money is an infinite resource, but experiences, like time, are finite.

- Principles to note when disagreeing with someone who is more powerful than you, 
    - Do:
        •	Explain that you have a different opinion and ask if you can voice it.
        •	Restate the original point of view or decision so it’s clear you understand it.
        •	Speak slowly — talking in an even tone calms you and the other person down.
    - Don’t:
        •	Assume that disagreeing is going to damage your relationship or career — the consequences are often less dramatic than we think.
        •	State your opinions as facts; simply express your point of view and be open to dialogue.
        •	Use judgment words, such as “hasty,” “foolish,” or “wrong,” that might upset or incite your counterpart.

- Rules for following Circadian rhythm of Body, 
	- No food for at least 2 hours after waking up
	- Try to have meals within 10 hours in a day 
	- Stop eating at least 2 hours before sleep
	- Try to be in bed for at least 8 hours

- Public Key infrastructure, 
    -   Uses signature (A message authentication code (MAC) is a bit of data that’s used to verify which entity sent a message, and to ensure that a message hasn’t been modified.) based on Shared secret. Signature can be verified by public key but can only be generated using corresponding private key. 
    - Based on public key cryptography (a.k.a. Asymmetric cryptography)
        - public key that can be distributed 
        - private key which is kept confidential by server
    - You can encrypt some data with the public key. The only way to decrypt that data is with the corresponding private key.
    - You can sign some data with the private key. Anyone who knows the corresponding public key can verify the signature, proving which private key produced it.    
    - A certificate is a data structure that contains a public key and a name. The data structure is then signed. The signature binds the public key to the name
    -  The entity that signs a certificate is called the issuer (or certificate authority) and the entity named in the certificate is called the subject.

- Economics
    - Most basic economic principle is less is demanded at higher price than at a lower price.
	- Knowledge is never perfect and the longer the time between decision and its consequences the wider the gray area of uncertainty. One of the ways of dealing with this uncertainty is to prepare alternate courses of action.
	- Those businesses which come closest to the optimal size of inventory will have their profit prospects enhanced.
	- Investment is a way of transferring resources to where they have alternate uses that are more valuable than where they are.
	- In case of physical quantities of natural resources, economic concepts of cost, prices and present values must be considered if practical conclusions are to be reached. Any amount of natural resources will count for little without considering costs for extraction and processing.
	- The real cost of anything is still its value in alternative usage. e.g. The real cost of building a bridge are the other things that could have been built with same labor and material.
	- The nirvana fallacy is the informal fallacy of comparing actual things with unrealistic, idealized alternatives. comparing imperfect market solution to a government solution. 
	- politics reduces cost of irrationality
	- In price-coordinated economy, nobody needs to know specifics of all the things. 
    - A price artificially raised tends to cause more to be supplied and less to be demanded than when prices are left to be determined in a free market.
	- The crucial requirement for maintaining growth and progress is that successful experiments be continued and unsuccessful experiments be terminated.
     - What is important is not the success or failure of particular individuals or companies, but the success of particular knowledge and insights in prevailing despite the blindness or resistance of others. Given the scarcity of such resources, an economy in which they have decisive advantages is an economy which itself has greater advantages in creating higher standards of living. A Society that taps all kinds of talents from all kind of resources has advantage.No economic system can depend on the continuing wisdom of select few (Existing leaders). Economic pressures (Competition @ Marketplace, irrate stackholders etc.) can force leaders to change course. Hence economies under the thumb of commisars have seldom matched track record of capitalist economies. 
	- The difference between limited knowledge of business executive from government official is that he is received instructions from others on what to do while government official is giving instructions to others and compelling them to obey. 
	- The very thing that makes a modern industrial society so efficient and so effective in raising living standards 
    - the constant quest for newer and better ways of getting work done and more goods produced
    - also makes it impossible to keep on doing things the same old familiar ways with same workers doing same job.
    - What people will bid for bonds depends on how much they could get for the same money by putting it somewhere else. That is why bond prices go down when interest rate goes up and vice-versa. A Bond with 105 a year from now is not worth buying for 100 today if the current interest rate is 6 percent.
	- For a period of year, bonds are likely to be much safer than stocks. For a period of 20 or 30 years, the risk of inflation threatens the value of bonds or other assets with fixed amounts.Even in the absense of inflation, stock prices can generally be relied on to rise over a period of decades while bond prices and the prices of other fixed assets do not. 
	- "It is wrong for people to be penalized for things that are not their fault" - This implicitly changes subject from risk to morality.
	- Politics and economics differ readily in a way they deal with time. 
	- In economics, future consequences are anticipated in concept of "present value". 
	- In the context of National Economy, Avoid "Fallacy of composition" - What applies to part applies to the whole. 
	- GDP - sum total of everything produced within a nation's borders. Over the period of generations, the goods and services which constitute national output change so much that statistical comparisons become practically meaningless.
	- Rare (or in limited supply) metals like Gold, silver were chosen so as to deprive those in powers from expanding money supply which triggers inflation.
	- As tax rates reach higher levels, particular economic activities may be abandoned by those who do not find the net rate of return on these activities, after taxes, to be enough to justify efforts.
	- Inflation is in effect hidden tax. The money that people have saved is robbed of part of its purchasing power, which is quietly transferred to the government that issues new money.
	- By setting interest rate on the money it lends to the banks, central banks indirectly control the interest rate that banks will charge general public. 
	- The most basic function of government is to provide a framework of law and order, within which the people are free to engage in whatever economic and other activities they choose. Some other functions are, 
		- Military defence 
		- Setting standards
	- Specific knowledge is far more important than general expertise. 
	- Media journalists love to feature the fortunes or misfortunes of particular individual/groups etc. and tend to present these stories as if they are typical of what is happening over all.
	- The temptation is always to try to "solve" the problem of those whose plight has been singled out for attention, without regard for the effects elsewhere.
	- Absolute advantage - One country, for any number of reasons, can produce some things cheaper than another
	- Comparative advantage - One country is efficient in producing product more efficiently than other country. Britain has not produced enough food to feed itself in more than a century but it can afford to do so since it has concentrated efforts on producing things in which it has comparative advantage.
	- Financial leverage - Ratio between assets and liabilities.It provides a quick way to quantify how much risk a financial business is taking on.A 10:1 levered firm is wiped out if assets lose 1/11th (~9.09%) of their value.
	- In domestic or international markets, exchanges take place only to the extent that both parties benefit. 
 
	- complexity is a means of rationalizing opacity in societies that pretend to transparency.
	- The market is merely a mechanism thorough which millions of human beings express their own preferences and values, rather than have some elite with political power impose that elite's preferences and values on all. To say "the market decides" is only to say that these millions of people decide instead of having decisions imposed on them. Ecnomics is the study of the use of scarce resources for alternative uses, then it follows that there will always be unmet needs.
	- Economics is about trade-offs and not "needs" and "solutions".
	- Efficiency is defined as most effective way to fulfil people's desires.
	- Competition is the condition in the market in which there is no way to keep out those who wish to enter an industry. 
	- It would require people to stop and think, instead of being swept along by emotions, rhetoric or of the moment. For those who are willing to stop, economics provides the tools for evaluating poin terms of logical implications and empirical evidence.


- Negotiations 
	- Leverage: Preparation is vital. Leverage comes from knowing what they need. The person that is more comfortable with “no deal” usually has more leverage.
	- Goals: Make them specific and aim high. Use recognized third-party sources or the other side’s previous deals. This will give you confidence and reduce fear.
	- Negotiate Process: Make sure they have the authority to say yes. Establish that information exchange is not binding. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”
	- Establish and Maintain Trust: If you tell me a drought is coming and my first instinct is to buy a canoe, I’m walking away. Lack of trust can kill even the best deals.
	- Information Exchange: Listening = more leverage. Don’t go zero-sum; expand the pie and create value.
	- Offers: If you don’t have good information, let them make the first offer. If you have good information, go first. Ask for the most you can justify. Don’t be too reasonable at first — most people expect a back and forth.
	- Concessions: Link them with “if…then.” Make sure they recognize you’re giving up something of value so they feel the need to reciprocate.
	- When Things Break Down: Don’t make ultimatums if you don’t have to. Ignore their ultimatums. If it gets ugly, involve a third party.
	- Closing And Commitment: You want them to feel happy. This creates follow through and better subsequent negotiations.
    - Principled negotiation techniques
        - Separate people from the problem
        - Focus on interests not positions 
        - Generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do
        - Insist that results be based on some objective standard (like market value, expert opinion, custom or law)

- Idly batter Tips
	- Urad - Dont throw away soaked water. wash only once and soak only for 2 hours (so that urad dal mixture gets fermented and not soaked water). Urad acts as yeast and responsible for fermentation and not rice or methi. Urad has to be ground first like bitten egg white. 
	- Rice - Soak for 4 hours and throw away water. Add methi to Rice. Dont use rice rawa. add 2 castor beans (shells removed).
	- Add salt just before making idli. 

- Narratives 
	- Narratives are not the truth; rather, they nudge you to understand the truth in a particular way. They are never neutral or innocent; they are always strategic. Narratives are about perceptions – of events and goals. The most important requisite for a narrative to be successfully sold is a receptive audience.
	- People’s perceptions are filtered through their emotion; they tend to interpret the world according to what they want to see. Feed their expectations, manufacture a reality to match their desires, and they will fool themselves.
    - The best of deception is based on ambiguity, mixing fact and fiction so that one cannot be disentangled from the other. Control people’s perceptions of reality and you can control them.

- Economics, 
	- Laissez-faire is a policy of minimum governmental interference in the economic affairs of individuals and society

- Howard marks on Investments 
	- Develop the mindset that you don't make money on what you buy and sell; you make money on what you hold. Think more. Trade less.
	- What really matters is the performance of your holdings over next five or ten years and how the value at the end of the period compares to the amount you invested and to your needs. 
	- Most investors and anyone who understands limitations regarding outperformance would probably be better off holding index funds over the long term.

- Islam vs christianity, 
	- A key difference between Islam and Christianity is that the former has far more to say on political governance. Mohammad was not only a prophet, but the political leader of an official state, and thus had views on governance and law which are officially prescribed by the faith.

- Saudi Arabia
	- The Saudi economy is essentially a massive wealth redistribution scheme. Saudi citizens feel entitled to oil wealth due to their loyalty to the crown, but not everyone can work for Aramco (it doesn’t help that the oil industry has low labor intensity), so they need to draw wealth another way.
	- much of oil money flows into an enormous welfare state. This is treated by the royal family as a way to buy loyalty, so they aren’t too concerned with where it’s going or why.
	- the oil industry carries the Saudi state and economy, the non-oil half of the Saudi economy has little pressure to be efficient, so businessmen and the state apparatus monitoring them can easily afford to be corrupt.

- Politics and Leadership
    - Three dimensions that govern the world, 
        - Essential
        - influential
        - interchangeable 

    - Five rules for leaders to succeed, 
        -  Rule 1: Keep your winning coalition as small as possible. A small coalition allows a leader to rely on very few people to stay in power. Fewer essentials equals more control andcontributes to more discretion over expenditures. 
        -  Rule 2: Keep your nominal selectorate as large as possible. Maintain a large selectorate of interchangeables and you can easily replace any troublemakers in your coalition, influentials and essentials alike. After all, a large selectorate permits a big supply of substitute supporters to put the essentials on notice that they should be loyal and well behaved or else face being replaced. 
        - Rule 3: Control the flow of revenue 
        - Rule 4: Pay your key supporters just enough to keep them loyal. 
        - Rule 5: Don’t take money out of your supporter’s pockets to make the people’s lives better.

    -In politics, coming to power is always about convenient or helpful for a purpose, but possibly not completely honest or moral.

    - Most professions, even ones that look wildly different, live under the umbrella of “Understanding how people respond to incentives, how to convincingly solve their problems, and how to work with others who are difficult to communicate with and/or disagree with you.”
    - self-interest is a freight train of persuasion.
    - Start with the assumption that everyone is innocently out of touch and you’ll be more likely to explore what’s going on through multiple points of view, instead of cramming what’s going on into the framework of your own experiences.
    -  politics is about getting and keeping political power. It is not about the general welfare of “We, the people.” 
    - political survival is best assured by depending on few people to attain and retain office. 
    - when the small group of cronies knows that there is a large pool of people waiting on the sidelines, hoping to replace them in the queue for gorging at the public trough, then the top leadership has great discretion over how revenue is spent and how much to tax.
    - dependence on a small coalition liberates leaders to tax at high rates.
    -  where politics are concerned, ideology, nationality, and culture don’t matter all that much.
    - Hsun Tzu (Chinese philosopher)
        - Man is born with a love of gain. If he indulges this love, he will be quarrelsome and greedy, shedding all sense of courtesy or humility. He is born with feelings of envy and hatred, and if he indulges these, they will lead him into violence and villainy and all sense of loyalty and good faith will disappear. Man is born with desires of the senses, and if he indulges these, he will be licentious and wanton and will observe neither propriety nor principles. If he is clever, he will surely be a robber; if he is brave, he will be a bandit; if he is able, he will cause trouble; if he is a debater, his arguments will make nonsense.

- Three Languages of Politics by Arnold Kling
  - Liberals see the world as a battle between victims and oppressors.
  - Conservatives see the world as a battle between civilization and barbarism.
  - Libertarians see the world as a battle between freedom and coercion.

- Food 
	- When making noodles (instant or otherwise), a pinch of soda to the boiling water will add a springy, Kollywood stunt actor texture to the noodles. And finally, if you add a pinch when parboiling peeled potatoes, baking soda will break down the pectin in the cell walls of the potato, which will help you get the most astonishingly crispy, golden brown colour and texture when frying them.

    -  The rules of politics dictate that leaders to do no more for the people than is absolutely essential to prevent rebellion. Leaders who spend on public welfare at the expense of their essentials are courting disaster. 

- Dictator's Handbook 
    - Education, 
        - Highly educated people are potential threats to autocrats and so autocrats make sure to limit educational opportunity.
        - When the leadership relies on few essentials, higher education is for the children of the powerful; when the bloc of essentials is big, it is for the betterment of everyone.

    - Securities fraud is more likely to be committed by firms with financial problems and a large coalition than by firms with comparable financial problems and a small coalition. After all, executives who depend on a relatively large coalition are particularly vulnerable to being replaced when corporate performance is poor. Being at greater risk of deposition, larger coalition executives try to hide poor corporate performance through fraudulent reporting. 20 What is more, one of the best early-warning indicators of corporate fraud is that senior management is paid less—not more—than one would expect given the firm’s reported performance! 

    - Let’s be clear, democrats act as if they care about the welfare of their people because they need their support. They are not helping out of the goodness of their hearts, and their concern extends only as far as their own people—the ones from whom they need a lot of supporters. Democrats cannot greatly enrich their essential backers by handing out cash. There are simply too many people who need rewarding. Democrats need to deliver the public policies their coalition wants. 

    - Who makes up the essentials in a corporation? The coalition typically includes no more than a few people in senior management and the members of the board of directors. These directors are drawn from a mix of senior management in the company, large institutional shareholders, handpicked friends and relatives of the CEO (generally described as civic leaders, no doubt), and the CEO herself. In the parlance of economists who study corporations, the makeup of these boards boils down to insiders (employees), grey members (friends, relatives), and outsiders. One part of any corporate board’s duties is to appoint, retain, or remove CEOs. 
        - Leaders know that it is better to have incompetent loyals than competent rivals. 
        - Principle of choosing close advisors who can not rise to the top is good advice. 

    - The easiest way to incentivize the leader to liberalize policy is to force him to rely on tax revenue to generate funds. Once this happens, the incumbent can no longer suppress the population because the people won’t work if he does. 

    - Designated seats for underrepresented minorities is another means by which leaders reduce the number of people upon whom they are dependent. Such policies are advertised as empowering minorities, whether they are women, or members of a particular caste or religion. In reality they empower leaders. That a candidate is elected by a small subset of the population reduces the number of essentials required to retain power. At a very basic level, electoral victory in a two-party parliamentary system requires the support of half the people in half the districts; that is, in principle, 25 percent of the voters. Suppose 10 percent of the seats were reserved for election by one specific group that happens to be geographically concentrated (such as gay voters in the Castro in our earlier account of Harvey Milk’s election in San Francisco). To retain half the seats in parliament, the incumbent party need only retain 40 percent of the regular single member district seats, which is readily done with just over 22 percent of the vote. So by focusing on districts in which the privileged minority is prevalent, a party can reduce the number of votes it requires by 12 percent.  Delegated positions also make it easier to form a small coalition. 
	- A SUCCESSFUL LEADER ALWAYS PUTS THE WANTS OF his essential supporters before the needs of the people.  Without the support of his coalition a leader is nothing and is quickly swept away by a rival. 
	- economy and decreased aid receipts, also faced a mass rebellion. When autocrats lack abundant resources they have a more difficult time managing the people. First and foremost, leaders must pay their essential backers or they will be gone.
    - Leaders without adequate revenues from aid, natural resources, or borrowing must obtain them by encouraging the people to work and by taxing them. Unfortunately for leaders, many of the public goods that increase productivity also improve the people’s ability to coordinate and, therefore, protest. Further, because the leader needs the tax revenues  the workers provide, such protests are more likely to be met with concessions than in a resource-rich nation or one with huge cash reserves. The factors that lead to rebellion are relatively uncomplicated. How much a leader does to enhance the welfare of the people by providing public goods determines the desire of the people to rebel. The level of freedom determines the ease with which they can act upon these desires by taking to the streets.
	- History is full of democratic Davids beating autocratic Goliaths. 
	-  Autocrats and democrats, at one level, fight over the exact same thing: staying in power. At another level, they are motivated to fight over different things. Democrats more often than autocrats fight when all other means of gaining policy concessions from foreign foes fail. In contrast, autocrats are more likely to fight casually, in the pursuit of land, slaves,and treasure. 
	- Three dimensions of political life - Essentials, influentials and interchangeables
	- A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and the real reason. - J.P. Morgan
        - Ground rules, 
		    - First among these is that we should never let the quest for perfection block the way to lesser improvement.
		    - Leaders will always like set of interchangeables to be very large and group of influentials and essentials to be small. 
    - Members of a small coalition live in luxurious, but constant, fear: make the coalition smaller, as their leader wants, and they may be out; make the coalition bigger and their special privileges diminish. But decreased privileges are much better than the danger of being out altogether.
    - There are two times when members of essential coalition is most receptive to improve life of many (People or shareholder)
        - When a leader has just come to power 
        - When a leader is so old or decrepit that he won't last longer. 
    - Coalition whose leaders face serious economic strains understand that their days of luxury and splendor are numbered.
        - Behind the world of misery and oppression lie governments run by small cliques of essentials who are loyal to leaders who can make them rich. Behind the world of freedom and prosperity lie governments that depend on the backing of a substantial coalition of ordinary people drawn from a large pool of influentials, who are in turn drawn from a large pool of interchangeables. It is not difficult to draw a line from the poverty and oppression of the world to the corrupt juntas and brutal dictators who skim from their country’s revenues to stay in power. Politics, and political institutions, define the bounds of the people’s lives.
        -  We have learned that just about all of political life revolves around the size of the selectorate, the influentials, and the winning coalition. Expand them all, and the interchangeables no more quickly than the coalition, and everything changes for the better for the vast majority of people. They are liberated to work harder on their own behalf, to become better educated, healthier, wealthier, happier, and free. Their taxes are reduced and their opportunities in life expand dramatically. We can get to these moments of change faster through some of the fixes proposed here but sooner or later every society will cross the divide between small-coalition, large-selectorate misery to a large coalition that is a large proportion of the selectorate—and peace and plenty will ensue. With a little bit of hard work and good luck this can happen everywhere sooner, and if it does we all will prosper from it.

- Conversation Skills 
	- Don't interrupt - A conversation is best when both parties are interested, engaged, and want to share. If you interrupt you show that you are uninterested and you blunt the other person’s motivation to share. 
	- Accept, Don’t Seek    
	- Gauge Interest  
	- Ask Questions - An ideal conversation is a mix of listening, asking questions, and sharing in a way that allows the other person to politely guide the conversation. 
    - Verbalize when you change your mind- eg. "Ok, maybe you’re right. I hadn’t thought about that before."
	- Disagree Positively 
		- Benchmarking - If you get a lot of single word answers, you are not keeping the other person interested. 
		- 50% Talk Time 
		- Depth - Real depth doesn’t happen unless both parties are sharing, so you must be willing to be vulnerable and share things about yourself, and must also have the awareness to ask questions to induce the other person to do the same.

- Russel Bertrand on Skepticism 
    - As per Pyrrhonism, we never know enough to be sure that one course of action is wiser than another.
    - 3 rules, 
        - when the experts are agreed, the opposite opinion cannot be held to be certain
        - that when they are not agreed, no opinion can be regarded as certain by a non-expert
        - when they all hold that no sufficient grounds for a positive opinion exist, the ordinary man would do well to suspend his judgement.
    - opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists
    - Passion is measure of lack of rational conviction (Opinions in politics and religion are almost always held passionately) 
    - Respectability, regularity and routine—the whole cast-iron discipline of a modern industrial society—have atrophied the artistic impulse, and imprisoned love so that it can no longer be generous and free and creative, but must be either stuffy or furtive.
    - Man is essentially a dreamer, wakened sometimes for a moment by some peculiarly obtrusive element in the outer world, but lapsing again quickly into the happy somnolence of imagination.

--- Diet Regimen recommendations from BMJ, 
    - Sugar – cut it out altogether, although it will be in the blueberries, strawberries and raspberries you are allowed to eat. Cakes and biscuits are a mixture of sugar and starch that make it almost impossible to avoid food cravings; they just make you hungrier!!
    - Reduce starchy carbs a lot -  Remember they digest down into surprising amounts of sugar. If possible just cut out the ‘White Stuff’ like bread, rice, pasta, potato , crackers and cereals.
    - All green veg/salads are fine…Eat as much of these as you can –turn the white stuff green
    So that you still eat a good big dinner try substituting veg such as broccoli, courgettes or green beans for your mash, pasta or rice – still covering them with your gravy, Bolognese or curry! Cauliflower rice is now widely available
    - Fruit is trickier… Some tropical fruits like bananas, oranges, grapes, mangoes or pineapple have too much sugar in and can set those carb cravings off. Berries are better and can be eaten; blueberries, raspberries, strawberries apples and pears too.
    - Eat healthy proteins… Try basing your meals on non-processed meat like chicken or red meat, eggs (three eggs a day is not too much), fish – particularly oily fish such as salmon, mackerel or tuna –are fine and can be eaten freely. Plain full fat yoghurt makes a good breakfast with the berries. Processed meats such as bacon, ham, sausages or salami are not as healthy and should only be eaten in moderation.
    - Healthy fats are fine in moderation… Yes, fats can be fine in moderation: olive oil is very useful, butter may be tastier than margarine and coulde better for you! Coconut oil is great for stir fries. Four essential vitamins A, D, E and K are only found in some fats or oils. Please avoid margarine, corn oil and vegetable oil.
    -  Beware ‘low fat’ foods. They often have sugar or sweeteners added to make them palatable. Full fat mayonnaise and pesto are definitely on!!
    - Cheese only in moderation… It’s a very calorific mixture of fat, and protein.
    - Snacks: avoid, as habit forming. But un-salted nuts such as almonds or walnuts are OK to stave off hunger. The occasional treat of strong dark chocolate 70% or more in small quantity is allowed
    - Alcohol is full of carbs… Sadly many alcoholic drinks are full of carbohydrate – for example, beer is almost ‘liquid toast’ hence the beer belly!! The odd glass of dry white, red wine or spirits is not too bad if it doesn’t make you hungry afterwards – or just plain water with a slice of lemon.
    - Sweeteners can trick you…  Finally, about sweeteners and what to drink – sweeteners have been proven to tease your brain into being even hungrier, making weight loss more difficult – drink tea, coffee, and water or herb teas. (100ml milk is 1 teaspoon of sugar)


    - Pascal's Wager - Pascal thought that evidence cannot settle the question of whether God exists, so he proposes that you should bet, or wager, on God because of what's at stake: you have lots to gain and not much to lose.

- Patrick mckenzie on Banks
  - Banks are extremely good at tracking one kind of truth, ledgers. They are extremely bad at tracking certain other forms of truth, for structural reasons. Every interaction of the user with it feels like being Bill Murray in Groundhog Day: the people you’re talking to remember literally nothing of what they’ve promised before, what you’ve told them, and the months or years of history that lead to this moment.
  - The boundaries of systems are responsible for a huge percentage of all operational issues at banks.
  - Ticketing system enforces  an invariant in terms of assignment of responsibility.
  - The bank builds many subsystems which interface with its core processing systems and ledgers. These systems are built so internal bank staff can see what a customer has done in their accounts and, perhaps, act upon those accounts on their behalf.
  - Most products offered to retail consumers and small businesses are relatively low margin, in absolute dollar terms. To be able to offer these, banks use various methods to cram down their support costs. Offshoring is often the face of these initiatives, but stratification by skill levels and powers granted is probably more important to understand.
  - Bank's system is tiered and set up to a) try to dissuade that guy from speaking to someone whose time is expensive and b) believes, on the basis of voluminous evidence, that you are likely that guy until proven otherwise.
  - Tier One rep will talk to dozens of folks a day. Many of those calls are… fairly aggravating, from the perspective of the agent. Tier One has limited ability to do anything useful; this depends on the firm and the silo within the firm, but they are largely read-only interfaces to money. The bank “forgets” about your issue as soon as you’re off the line with Tier One, and needs to be told it entirely de novo when you speak to Tier Two.
  -  Tier Two typically spent a few years in Tier One and has begun to specialize in a subfiefdom of banking. They have emerging competence into the nitty gritty of operations at their institution, at least with regards to that subfiefdom. They’re paid more, though not by much. They’re typically given more ability to do what my shop called “accommodations”, which means self-authorizing a resolution for a customer which costs money. Tier Two might be able to, for example, credit an account a small amount of money for an arbitrary reason and have the bank charge it off as an operations loss. 
  -  Due to the deskilling of the bank branch, the people at a bank branch, including the branch manager in many firms, can only offer solutions to relatively straightforward problems. For the other ones, they also have to call into a support phone tree. 
  -  Paper Letter to VP of Retail Banking, Office of the president or investor relations will often cause bank to swing into action.  These folks are professionals who are capable of keeping paper notes and having day-to-day recollection of things they have done in complex cases. They are managed and incentivize in a way which allows them to have agency. The formal customer support organization is very, very bad at this, at every tier. 
  -  As a sophisticated user of the banking system, a useful skill to have is understanding whether the ultimate solution to an issue facing you is probably available to Tier Two or probably only available to a professional earning six figures a year. You can then route your queries to the bank to get in front of the appropriate person with the minimal amount of effort expended on making this happen.

- Psychology, 
  - The rule for reciprocation. The rule says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.
  - The principle of social proof states that we use information about how others have behaved to help
us determine proper conduct for ourselves.
  - Contrast principle - There is a principle in human perception, the contrast principle, that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented one after another. Simply put, if the second item is fairly different from the first, we will tend to see it as more different than it actually is.
  - the strategy of starting with an extreme demand and then retreating to the more moderate one
produced the most money for the person using it.
  -  What the Freedman and Fraser findings tell us, then, is to be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests. Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger re-quests, it can also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors that are only remotely connected to the little one we did earlier. It’s this  second, general kind of influence concealed within small commitments that scares me. Even a small action has the potential  influence not only my future behavior but also my self-image in ways I may not want. And once a person’s self-image is altered, all sorts of subtle advantages become available to someone who wants to exploit that new image. 
  - commitments are most effective in changing a person’s self-image and future behavior when they are active, public, and effortful.
  - Lowballing - An advantage is offered that induces a favorable purchase decision; then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed.
  - In general, then, your best strategy when in need of emergency help is to reduce the uncertainties of those around you concerning your condition and their responsibilities. Be as precise as possible about your need for aid. Do not allow bystanders to come to their own conclusions because, especially in a crowd, the principle of social proof and the consequent pluralistic ignorance effect might well cause them to view your situation as a nonemergency. And request assistance of a single individual from the group of on-lookers. Fight the natural tendency to make a general request for help.Pick out one person and assign task to individual.
  - A halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dominates the way that person is viewed by other.
  - Humans are phenomenal suckers for flattery
  - it is not when we have a strong feeling of recognized personal accomplishment that we will seek to
bask in reflected glory. Instead, it will be when prestige (both public and private) is low that we will be intent upon using the successes of associated others to help restore image.

 - Deep inside is a sense of low personal worth that directs them to seek prestige not from the generation or promotion of their own attainments, but from the generation or promotion of their
associations with others of attainment.

- when we are confronted with what appears to be an authority figure’s influence attempt, “Is this authority truly an expert?”.The question impels us to distinguish between relevant authorities and irrelevant authorities. Before submitting to authority influence, it would be wise to ask a second simple question: “How truthful can we expect the expert to be here?” Authorities, even the best informed, may not present their information honestly to us

- scarcity principle—that opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited. As soon as we feel the tide of emotional arousal that flows from scarcity influences, we should use that rise in arousal as a signal to stop short. Panicky, feverish reactions have no place in wise compliance decisions. We need to calm ourselves and regain a rational perspective. Once that
is done, we can move to the second stage by asking ourselves why we want the item under consideration. If the answer is that we want it primarily for the purpose of owning it, then we should use its availability to help gauge how much we want to spend for it.However, if the answer is that we want it primarily for its function (that is, we want something good to drive, drink, eat, etc.), then we must remember that the item under consideration will function equally well whether scarce or plentiful. Quite simply, we need to recall that the scarce cookies didn’t taste any better.

- The trick in any field—from finance to careers to relationships—is being able to survive the short-run problems so you can stick around long enough to enjoy the long-term growth.

- People follow incentives, not advice
- incentives lean heavily toward not rocking the boat. So everyone keeps paddling long after the market becomes unsustainable.
- One of the strongest pulls of incentives is the desire for people to hear only what they want to hear and see only what they want to see.
- It’s just so hard to be purely objective when incentives push you toward one direction
- When good and honest people can be incentivized into crazy behavior, it’s easy to underestimate the odds of the world going off the rails.
- The sore truth is that complexity sells better.
- Complexity gives a comforting impression of control, while simplicity is hard to distinguish from cluelessness.



- Geopolitics, country's life cycle
  - Re-alignment/Regime change (roughly every 4th generation) happens every 80 to 100 years.
  - There are no permanent enemies or friends. 


- How to be super communicator?
 - every discussion is made of up different kind of conversations, 
    - practical - solve problems
    - emotional - expectation is to emphathize 
    - social - how relate to us/society 

    if you are not having same kind of conversation at the same time then that mismatch will result both not able to hear each other. Super communication is about knowing kind of conversation happening and responding accordingly. 

  - in conflict, humans have instinct to try to control the things. but it is better do opposite, let other person have their say in the way they want to have it and they will more listen what you have to say. 

  - if you listen to others it is more likely they will listen to you. Ask "tell me about it?" "What do you like about it?" 

  - you are likely to enjoy longevity, happiness and success and reliable predictor of that is if you have deep, meaningful connections at age 45. we form connections through conversations.

- Interesting Principles (ref: https://effectiviology.com/shirky-principle/)
  - Shirky principle
    - Entities often promote problems that they benefit from
   - I Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution
   - Complex solutions (like a company, or an industry) can become so dedicated to the problem they are the solution to, that often they inadvertently perpetuate the problem
   - ”Every entity tends to prolong the problem it is solving”
   - Accounting for the Shirky principle can be beneficial when it comes to several things:
        -     Understanding past and current behavior. For example, it can help you understand why certain institutions are seemingly so bad at solving certain problems, despite all the resources—like time, effort, and money—that they dedicate to those problems.
        - Predicting future behavior. For example, it can help you predict that an executive will keep perpetuating a certain problem, in order to improve their own status within a company, even though this leads to worse outcomes for the company itself.
        - Modifying behavior. For example, if this makes you aware of someone’s incentive to prolong a problem, that could lead you to either eliminate the perverse incentive or create a stronger disincentive. Similarly, this could lead you to point out the issue to the entity in question, in order to encourage them to try and change their behavior themselves if doing so can benefit them in the long term.
  - Peter Principle
    - a person in an organization will be promoted to the level of their incompetence. At which point their past achievements will prevent them from being fired, but their incompetence at this new level will prevent them from being promoted again, so they stagnate in their incompetence.
  - Cuo bono? -> who benefits?
  - Hanlon's Razor ->never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity”
  - Parkinson’s law ->work expands to consume the resources available for its completion
  - Bikeshedding (also referred to as the law of triviality) describes a phenomenon where people spend excessive resources—especially time and energy—dealing with relatively minor issues.


- To a very large extent, your productivity is a result of what you choose to work on. Keep things perceived as easy out of that list. When you can't, postponing an "easy" thing can make it both "harder" and smaller.


- Notes from Thinking fast and slow, 
  - When we come across some piece of information that confirms our priors, we generally assume it’s true. If we question it, it’s only to ask if it can be true. If a piece of information dis-confirms our priors, we often miss or ignore it. If we pay attention to it at all, it’s merely to consider whether it must be true, a far different and more forgiving standard. “the stubborn persistence of challenged beliefs.”
  - What we “find” is often what we wanted or expected to find all along
  - “The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.”
  - “What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact"
  - To overcome our inherent biases is for us to ask the best and smartest people we know to tear our ideas apart.
  - “The power of reasons is an illusion. The belief will not change when the reasons are defeated. The causality is reversed. People believe the reasons because they believe in the conclusion.”
  - Internet businesses are financially incentivized not for truth, but for keeping their users engaged. You do that by giving the people what they want.


- Thomas Sowell's quotes 
  - “Intellect is not wisdom.  Most modern intellect is the ability to memorize information.Intellects worship access to information rather than the application of the lessons"
  - “When you want to help people, you tell them the truth. When you want to help yourself, you tell them what they want to hear.”
  -  "The truth is often not complicated. What gets complex is evading the truth.”
  - “Bailing out people who made ill-advised mortgages makes no more sense than...Bailing out people who lost their life savings in Las Vegas casinos”
  - "Inflation is a hidden tax.The money people have saved is robbed of part of its purchasing power,  Which is quietly transferred to the government that issues new money.It is a way to take people's wealth without having to openly raise taxes"
  - "The problem is that Johnny doesn't know what thinking is. He confuses it with feeling”
  - “It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance.”
  - “There are no solutions, only trade-offs.”
  - “Income distribution: The cold fact is most income is not distributed. It is earned.”
  - “The great escape of our times is escape from personal responsibility for the consequences of one’s own behavior.”
  - “When people get used to preferential treatment, equal treatment seems like discrimination.”
  - “Too much of what is called 'education' is little more than an expensive isolation from reality.”
  -  "There's now a world in which the success of others is a grievance, rather than an example"
  -  “Since this is an era of 'fairness' & 'social justice...What is your 'fair share' of what someone else has worked for?”

- Basic Economics of Credit card,
    - Banks that issue credit cards generally make money from the fees that merchants pay to accept cards. Say those fees are 2%: If you buy a thing for $100 with a credit card, you pay $100, the seller gets $98, and your bank keeps $2. [6]
    - Banks attract customers by rebating them a portion of those fees as “rewards” or “cash back.” Perhaps your bank gives you back $1 on that transaction, and keeps the other $1 itself.
    - In a competitive market, banks attract customers by rebating them more than all of the fees, on certain types of transactions, with the hope that the customers will like that offer but mostly use the cards for other transactions. “Rebating interchange to earn share of wallet,” Patrick McKenzie calls it: “Say, for example, the card rebates 1.5%, but only for … bookstores. Any bookstore. For all other transactions, it is 1%. The thing you would love with this offering is to preferentially attract people who are very emotionally invested in being readers and who spends very little of [their] on-this-card wallet on books. The emotional investment in the story the card offers brings the customer in; the blended cost to acquire the customer is closer to [the] 1% industry standard and not to the 1.5% headline number.”
    - So a bank might offer, like, “3% cash back on books, 1% on everything else,” and you say “ooh that sounds good,” get the card, and buy $40 worth of books and $40,000 of everything else. Then the bank is making money from you: It makes 1% (its 2% fee minus 1% cash back) on most of your transactions, and loses 1% (its 2% fee minus 3% cash back) on a small but emotionally salient minority of them.
    - Also of course if you carry a balance, by not paying off your card every month, the bank makes a lot of money by charging you interest. [7]
    - Conversely, if you get this card, buy $40,000 worth of books, and do all of your other spending on other cards, the bank is losing a lot of money on you: It loses 1% on every transaction. This is called “adverse selection.”


-    Some powerful ideas can be brought to bear in support of good critical and scientific thinking,    including the following.
        Analyze your situation carefully and fully (observation – paying mindful attention).

        Do the necessary research (assure sufficient domain knowledge to be able to apply critical thinking).

        Practice skepticism, beginning with yourself (and be sure you have plenty of inputs that don’t share your ideas, views, beliefs, and commitments).

        Challenge all assumptions.

        Withhold judgment as long as possible.

        Revise your conclusions based upon new evidence. For Christians, Hell is having your own way and being stuck with it. That concept works for science too. Ideally, it is like living in a world with constant auto-correct. It’s sometimes (and sometimes hilariously or tragically) wrong, but it’s usually an efficient improvement.

        Remember that errors and mistakes are evidence too.

        Keep looking for new evidence.

        Keep testing your ideas and hypotheses.

        Check with relevant subject matter experts.

        Emphasize data over belief and process over outcomes.

        Consider that with which you disagree as generously as possible using the philosophical “principle of charity.”

        Keep looking for what you (and others) might have missed.
