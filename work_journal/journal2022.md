- Economics 101 says that when a currency is devaluing & inflation is rising in the country, central banks usually raise the interest rates. This makes borrowing expensive & discourages spending. Less consumption will reduce demand for the assets, eventually bringing down inflation. Raising interest rates also increases demand for the currency, as it encourages people to save more.

    - Indian fintechs are overly dependent upon ‘Old Banks’ who have the chops to navigate the technology waters, and the lending landscape, and the regulatory compliance 
    - Multitasking, in short, is not only not thinking, it impairs your ability to think. Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it. Not learning other people’s ideas, or memorizing a body of information, however much those may sometimes be useful.

    -Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations.

- schadenfreude - a German word for taking pleasure at another’s misfortunes
- In auto industry, the only way to protect your margins is to have a balance of entry and premium products. Entry level products lets you build scale while premium products help you in pricing power and delivering better margins. Sway too much on either side and you either risk losing your margins or not have enough demand to implement economies of scale in your business.

- The most egalitarian societies, hunter-gatherer societies, actually have more envy that less egalitarian ones. This isn't obvious because their lack of wealth seems to imply they are not greedy, and thus, selfish like Westerners, but this is just wishful naïve thinking. There is no tribe where social harmony prevails because each man has as little as the next. For primitive egalitarian societies, envy is both a cause and an effect. Schoeck notes that such communities tend to have no conception of luck, and so see any objective relative prosperity as a sign of theft or alignment with evil forces. Schoeck discusses Native American, African, and Polynesian tribes, and note the strong social pressure for anyone better off to be lavish in hospitality and generous with gifts. He knows that if he fails in this, 'the voice of envy will speak out in the whispers of witchcraft' which would make his life very unpleasant.

- Envy prevents people from accumulating the wealth needed to create technology, and thus the free time needed to create art, science, literature, and philosophy. A lack of differentiation makes more apparent one's inadequacies, in that some will be more clever, athletic, or brave. When people are made equal in endowments, the only reason for not attaining a higher status is within us, our character, our essence.

- Our unprecedented wealth and comfort should have led to less envy, in that we all have access to the knowledge that brings self-actualization and self-esteem, but instead, it has lead to greater envy. The poorly paid op-ed writer of your local newspaper considers themselves not just equal to the rich, but better informed and more articulate, as proven by their many eloquent and insightful essays. Their lack of status motivates envy because they feel just as worthy, as competent, as those who are doing better. David Brooks highlighted this in his book Bobos in Paradise.

- Praise from the praiseworthy is beyond all rewards, why we are more hurt by the lukewarm approval of men we respect than the contempt of fools.

- While there is nothing wrong with having wealth or wanting more, this should be of secondary importance, and wisdom is all about priorities. We should be encouraged to appreciate excellence in others to build excellence in ourselves. This takes faith, in that we have to believe our excellence in character, even if not reflected in the current status hierarchy, is appreciated by someone we admire, if not now, then in the future.

- Lions, for example, are the only social species of cat.

- Effective decision making,
    - People Interventionistas - Often these people come armed with solutions to solve the first-order consequences of a decision but create worse second and subsequent order consequences.iatrogenics to refer to any effect resulting from intervention in excess of gain.

    - when the linkages between cause and effect are murky, the very people who caused the harm are often the people rewarded for improving the situation.

    - Second-order thinking is more deliberate. It is thinking in terms of interactions and time, understanding that despite our intentions our interventions often cause harm. Second order thinkers ask themselves the question “And then what?” This means thinking about the consequences of repeatedly eating a chocolate bar when you are hungry and using that to inform your decision. If you do this you’re more likely to eat something healthy.Extraordinary performance comes from seeing things that other people can’t see.

    - The key lesson here is that if we are to intervene, we need a solid idea of not only the benefits of our interventions but also the harm we may cause
        - Ways to go about "Second-order thinking", 
        - Always ask yourself “And then what?”
        - Think through time — What do the consequences look like in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 Years? 
        - Create templates like the second image above with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order consequences. Identify your decision and think through and write down the consequences. If you review these regularly you’ll be able to help calibrate your thinking.
        -(Bonus) If you’re using this to think about business decisions, ask yourself how important parts of the ecosystem are likely to respond. How will employees deal with this? What will my competitors likely do? What about my suppliers? What about the regulators? Often the answer will be little to no impact, but you want to understand the immediate and second-order consequences before you make the decision.

    - Typical Flaws ,
        - The first flaw is the inability to think through second and subsequent order consequences. They fail to realize that the second and subsequent order consequences exist at all or could outweigh the benefits. Most things in life happen at the second, third, or nth steps.
        - The second flaw is a distance from the consequences.
        - The third flaw is a bias for action. - If you’re a policy advisor or politician, or heck, even a modern office worker, social norms make it hard for you to say, “I don’t know.” You’re expected to have an opinion on everything.
        - The fourth flaw is one of the incentives, they have no or little skin in the game. They win if things go right and suffer no consequences if things go wrong.

- Intervention—by people or governments—should only be used when the benefits visibly outweigh the negatives . 
- A simple rule for the decision-maker is that intervention needs to prove its benefits and those benefits need to be orders of magnitude higher than the natural (that is non-interventionist) path.
- We must also recognize that some systems self-correct; this is the essence of homeostasis. Naive interventionists, or the interventionista, often deny that natural homeostatic mechanisms are sufficient, that “something needs to be done” — yet often the best course of action is nothing at all.

- A lot of extraordinary things in life are the result of things that are first-order negative, second order positive
- One big mistake people repeatedly make is focusing on proving themselves right, instead of focusing on achieving the best outcome. 


- Blockchain
    - Dapps are a growing movement of applications that use Ethereum to disrupt business models or invent new ones. 
    - Almost all dApps use either Infura or Alchemy in order to interact with the blockchain. 

- Buy now pay later 
    - The BNPL is a software company brokering a very complex credit transaction in a fashion which makes it free to the user, by producing ex nihilo high interest debt, manufactured out of the interchange fee the business paid. BNPL Companies originate the loan but they are not interested in owing it further. Typically, they dont want to be in business of borrowing and lending at a spread. They do not have franchise that attract deposits which they could use to lend out. 
    - Finance loves making simple things sound complicated because that ensures the continued employment of lot of finance professionals at high wages.
    - In most cases, BNPL ties with capital partner and they share risk of non-payment.
    -  A $100 pay in four transaction needs $75 of capital backing it for six weeks (because the user immediately pays a quarter upfront). The average amount of capital required over the term of the loan is half of that, due to repayment. If the BNPL was willing to pay 2% of the original transaction (sliced from their fee) to the capital provider in lieu of interest, the capital provider would receive $77 in repayments for their committed capital for 6 weeks, representing about 2.67% yield on $37.50 over 6 weeks. This works out to 25% annualized, give or take.
    - “Rails” are payment jargon for the technological and financial links between various entities which allow money movement. Visa provides rails, debit card networks provide rails, etc etc.
    -  BNPLs don't want to acquire one transaction; they want to acquire a continuing stream of transactions from a customer, ideally changing their purchasing behavior for certain sectors and charging their partners for the change.

- Techniques#Spacing effect 
    - A typical spaced repetition system includes these key components:
        - A schedule for review of information. Typical systems involve going over information after an hour, then a day, then every other day, then weekly, then fortnightly, then monthly, then every six months, then yearly. Guess correctly and the information moves to the next level and is reviewed less often. Guess incorrectly and it moves down a level and is reviewed more often.
        - A means of storing and organizing information. Flashcards or spaced repetition software (such as Anki and SuperMemo) are the most common options. Software has the obvious advantage of requiring little effort to maintain, and of having an inbuilt repetition schedule. Anecdotal evidence suggests that writing information out on flashcards contributes to the learning process.
        - A metric for tracking progress. Spaced repetition systems work best if they include built-in positive reinforcement. This is why learning programs like Duolingo and Memrise incorporate a points system, daily goals, leaderboards and so on. Tracking progress gives us a sense of progression and improvement.
        - A set duration for review sessions. If we practice for too long, our attention wanes and we retain decreasing amounts of information. Likewise, a session needs to be long enough to ensure focused immersion. A typical recommendation is no more than 30 minutes, with a break before any other review sessions.

- [Linux][SystemArchitecture] 
    - In Linux architecture, memory is separated into kernel space and user space. The kernel space is used to run the core kernel code and the device drivers. Processes running in kernel space have unrestricted access to all hardware, including CPU, memory, and disks. All other processes run in the user space, which relies on the kernel to access the hardware. Processes running in the user space use system calls to communicate with the kernel for privileged operations like disk or network I/O.A buggy code in a kernel module can easily crash the kernel. This is why Linux provides a way to run secure, verified sandboxed code in the kernel space through eBPF.

    - Why study history?
        - Unlike physics or economics, history is not a means for making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.

- On Markets - Being really right is a double-edged sword, because it makes you even more confident in your abilities. And you are inclined to lean even harder into your current beliefs. But markets are dynamic, and strategies that outperform today will likely underperform at some point down the road. At the end of the day, Valuation Matters.

- The harder we try with the conscious will to do something, the less we shall succeed. Proficiency and results come only to those who have learned the paradoxical art of doing and not doing, or combining relaxation with activity

- Nietzsche
    - In any population, you are going to have a group of people who are more talented/gifted/intelligent than average. Let’s call them The Strong. You are also going to have a group of people who are less talented/gifted/intelligent than average. Let’s call them The Weak
    - The Strong will naturally accrue the power in society for no other reason than they are more capable and talented than the others.
    - Because The Strong won their greater power and influence through outsmarting or outperforming others, they will come to adopt ethical beliefs that justify their position: that might makes right, that they are entitled to their privileged position, that they earned what is theirs. Nietzsche calls this “Master Morality.”
    - Because The Weak lost their power and influence by being outsmarted and outperformed, they will come to adopt ethical beliefs that justify their position: that people deserve aid and charity, that one should give away one’s possessions to the less fortunate, that you should live for others and not yourself. Nietzsche calls this “Slave Morality.”
    - Master/Slave Moralities have been in a kind of tension in every society for all of recorded history. Many political/social conflicts are side effects of the struggle between Master and Slave Moralities.
    - Nietzsche believed that the ideas of guilt, punishment and a “bad conscience” are all culturally constructed and used by The Weak to chip away at the dominance and power of The Strong. He also believed that Slave Morality is just as capable of corrupting and oppressing a society as Master Morality. He used Christianity as his primary example of this.
    - Nietzsche believed that Slave Morality stifled man’s greatest characteristics: creativity, innovation, ambition, and even happiness itself.
    -  Claiming that the weak people had to invent God so that they could believe their suffering actually meant something.

- History
    - history’s choices are not made for the benefit of humans. This is difficult to evaluate due to lack of scale.
    - There is no proof that cultures that are beneficial to humans must inexorably succeed and spread, while less beneficial cultures disappear. 
    - How modern science differs, 
        -  The willingness to admit ignorance. Modern science is based on the Latin injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It assumes that we don’t know everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the things that we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more  knowledge. No concept, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge. 
        -  The centrality of observation and mathematics. Having admitted ignorance, modern science aims to obtain new knowledge. It does so by gathering observations and then using mathematical tools to connect these observations into comprehensive theories.
        - The acquisition of new powers. Modern science is not content with creating theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies.
        - The willingness to admit ignorance has made modern science more dynamic, supple and inquisitive than any previous tradition of knowledge.
        - The willingness to admit ignorance has made modern science more dynamic, supple and inquisitive than any previous tradition of knowledge. This has hugely expanded our capacity to understand how the world works and our ability to invent new technologies. But it presents us with a serious problem that most of our ancestors did not have to cope with. Our current assumption that we do not know everything, and that even the knowledge we possess is tentative, extends to the shared myths that enable millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. If the evidence shows that many of those myths are doubtful, how can we hold society together? How can our communities, countries and international system function? All modern attempts to stabilise the sociopolitical order have had no choice but to rely on either of two unscientific methods: 
        - Take a scientific theory, and in opposition to common scientific practices, declare that it is a final and absolute truth. This was the method used by Nazis (who claimed that their racial policies were the corollaries of biological facts) and Communists (who claimed that Marx and Lenin had divined absolute economic truths that could never be refuted). 
        - Leave science out of it and live in accordance with a non-scientific absolute truth. This has been the strategy of liberal humanism, which is built on a dogmatic belief in the unique worth and rights of human beings – a doctrine which has embarrassingly little in common with the scientific study of Homo sapiens. 
        - Science, industry and military technology intertwined only with the advent of the capitalist system and the Industrial Revolution.
            -  social poverty, which withholds from some people the opportunities available to others;
            - biological poverty, which puts the very lives of individuals at risk due to lack of food and shelter.
            - Most scientific studies are funded because somebody believes they can help attain some political, economic or religious goal.
        - What did Asian cultures lacked when compared to European/British from 15th century onwards, 
            - They lacked the values, myths, judicial apparatus and sociopolitical structures that took centuries to form and mature in the West and which could not be copied and internalised rapidly. Asians organized their society differently.
        - France and the United States quickly followed in Britain’s footsteps because the French and Americans already shared the most important British myths and social structures. 
        - Europeans were used to thinking and behaving in a scientific and capitalist way even before they enjoyed any significant technological advantages
        -  European imperialists set out to distant shores in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories.
        -  Europeans favour present observations over past traditions
        - Banks are allowed to loan $10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes.


- decentralized finance?
    - Traditional finance involves many financial intermediaries like stock markets, hedge funds and banks. Banks, for example, stand in between savers and borrowers and, as we explain in Modern Principles, they perform useful services like evaluating borrowers and creating easy means of payments like credit cards and checks. Naturally, financial intermediaries also take a cut of the proceeds, about 8% of GDP!.
    - Decentralized finance replaces some of these intermediaries with code, smart contracts, that allows buyers and sellers, borrowers and lenders and others to interact more directly and we hope at lower cost and with greater innovation.

- Consumer lending 
    - Consumer lending seems easy, but it's not. There are three categories of people. Those that don't need credit. Those that need credit but manage money responsibly & will pay you back. And those that will take whatever credit they are offered, manage money poorly, and will default
    - Success in consumer lending is about finding a way to successfully differentiate between category 2 and 3. And it's not that easy - particularly because you can remain current on your loans for quite a while if you have access to more credit borrow more from A to repay B.

- Adam Smith in "The wealth of nations", 
    - an increase in the profits of private entrepreneurs is the basis for the increase in collective wealth and prosperity.
    - Egoism is altruism.
    -  Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in production.

- Mideval Europe
    - In Europe, kings and generals gradually adopted the mercantile way of thinking, until merchants and bankers became the ruling elite
    - The European conquest of the world was increasingly financed through credit rather than taxes, and was increasingly directed by capitalists whose main ambition was to receive maximum returns on their investments. 
    - The mercantile empires were simply much shrewder in financing their conquests.
    -  credit financed new discoveries; discoveries led to colonies; colonies provided profits; profits built trust; and trust translated into more credit. For Asian empires, Credit was secondary and during campaigns they ran out of fuel after a few thousand kilometres. Capitalist entrepreneurs only increased their financial momentum from conquest to conquest.
    - Due to uncertain nature of campaigns and risks involved, europeans adopted approach of limited liability joint stock companies where multiple investors bet money on campaign with less risk for individual. 
    - Decade by decade, western Europe witnessed the development of a sophisticated financial system that could raise large amounts of credit on short notice and put it at the disposal of private entrepreneurs and governments. This system could finance explorations and conquests far more efficiently than any kingdom or empire.
    - Capital trickles away from dictatorial states that fail to defend private individuals and their property. Instead, it flows into states upholding the rule of law and private property.
    - the British Empire was established and run largely by private joint-stock companies based in the London stock exchange

    -Institutions are hard to institute & maintain, because human beings are self-righteous, hubristic, and power-hungry (a la Trudeau "I will get my way no matter what"). We are always tempted to discard institutions when they become a short term nuisance/obstruction to expediency


- International payments,
    -  cross-border transfers: “Correspondent banking is an arrangement, where one bank (the correspondent) holds deposits
    owned by other banks (the respondents) and provides payments and other services to them.
    - “Closed loop” (or in-house) payment systems, where one organization (exclusively) provides the services to both originator and beneficiary.
    - Fintechs have developed very cost efficient cross-border payment services for often used currency pairs. They use local accounts in both currencies. As soon as the originator pays an amount to the account of the fintech in his country of residence, the fintech account in the country of residence of the beneficiary credits an equivalent amount. A real currency conversion is not necessary.
    - SWIFT's main function is to communicate payment instructions across borders, but without the actual clearing and settlement.
    - Ripple has tried to establish a faster wholesale alternative to correspondence banking with SWIFT, based on distributed ledger technology,
    - More than 90% of the $140 trillion of cross-border transmissions in 2020 – equivalent to 152 percent of global GDP – were signaled via SWIFT (The Economist 2021).
    - SWIFT operated a data center in the US where all messages were stored for 124 days. Since last few years, SWIFT has segregated message storage between Europe (for intra-europe transactions) and rest in US.
    - SPFS (System for Transfer of Financial Messages) is a Russian alternative to SWIFT.Mainly used within Russia. 
    - China operates the “Cross-Border Interbank Payment System” (CIPS). not only a financial messaging system such as SWIFT, but a complete payment system, also incorporating clearing and settlement.

    - Index providers like MSCI make money in three ways. They charge index funds and managers of exchange-traded funds a few basis points on the assets that track their benchmarks; they charge exchanges like CME a commission on each traded option or futures contract linked to their indices; and they charge subscription fees to a range of third-party users.

- Quotable "Quotes"
    - “A single arrow is easily broken, but not ten in a bundle” 
    - When one buys international stocks there are actually two trades here - one to buy the local currency and the other to buy the stock
    - Peter bernstein 
        - Survival is the only road to riches
        - The riskiest moment is when you’re right.That’s when you’re in the most trouble, because you tend to overstay the good decisions. 
        - When you invest, it’s not your wealth today, but it’s your future that you’re really managing.
        - Pascal’s Law: the consequences of decisions and choices should dominate the probabilities of outcomes
        - Risk-taking is an inevitable ingredient in investing, and in life, but never take a risk you do not have to take
        - Experience shapes memory; memory shapes our view of the future. 
        - there is a tendency for people to expect the status quo either to last indefinitely or to provide advance signals for shifting strategies.  The world does not work like that.  Surprise and shock are endemic to the system, and people should always arrange their affairs to that they will survive such events.

- Minto Pyramid principle
    - Applying the top-down structure of a pyramid in communication methods means that a direct answer is given to the question that has been asked. These could also be recommendations, the results from a study, thesis statement or other key points.
    - Minto Pyramid Principle inverts the traditional method that’s used to arrive at a conclusion. Usually, the conclusion in a text or presentation is given after the facts have been presented, and all analyses and supporting ideas have been discussed.
    - The reason to first make the recommendation and then offer the motivation is that the supervisors often already see the conclusion or recommendation coming when a flood of arguments and reasons is provided. This because they think in such a top-down way, focusing on the bigger picture.
    - Moreover, a direct communication method is more convincing than a conversation that beats about the bush. A direct communication style is a display of assertiveness and self-confidence.

- History
    - Each society has two groups 
        - commercial elites and military elites - and con icts occur based on the incentives of these groups. 
        - There are two types of institutions, inclusive institutions w and extractive institution. Roughly speaking with inclusive institutions the commercial elites have the upper hand, while with extractive institutions the military elites have the upper hand.
        - In a head to head contest between an extractive and inclusive society the extractive society is assumed to be more likely to prevail.

- [Optimistic concurrency][Databases] 
    - When OTP is generated, it must be getting saved in DB against Card Number. 
    - In that table, add version column (i.e. 'timestamp with time zone')
    - While beginning transaction, read this version and proceed with steps
    - Before commit, check the version as part of 'update ...where ' statement. If rows affected are 0, roll back the transaction.
    - prefer not using triggers 
    - Pessimistic locking (Select ....for update nowait) can not be used here since it requires stateful connection to database and locks can not be held across connections.
    - Alternative to version column is Hash/checksum but its computationally expensive and has some issues with column types like BLOB, LONG, LONG RAW etc. 
    - There is possibility of having Blocking inserts when having table with Unique constraint when two or more transactions are trying to enter same record.  

- Investment Portfolio
    - One is that it’s a bad idea to overhaul your portfolio when you’re afraid. The time to become more conservative is when things are going well, not when the world seems to be coming apart.

    - Dont go to bed earlier
    - Dont put clocks in bedroom and dont look at time (on smartphone) while sleeping

- How Petrodollars work
    - The crucial point that this highlights is that Russia’s reserve accumulation, like reserve accumulation by other oil and gas producers such as Norway or Saudi Arabia, is a source of funding in Western markets. The reserves do not simply sit idly in central banks accounts, they are lent out. With sanctions, the funding provided by Russia’s petro- and gas-dollars is in jeopardy. And that impacts not only the Russians.The Russian funds in European central banks are not simply pools of money sitting idly. They are part of complex chains of transactions that may now be put in jeopardy by the sanctions.This is true more generally for global financial markets at a time of huge uncertainty.

    - Removing russia from SWIFT may accelerate the process of de-dollarization
    - In response to covid-19, the Federal Reserve increased its total assets from $4.1 trillion in January 2020 to $8.3 trillion as of August 2021. This historic level of money printing has led to US inflation reaching its highest level in 40-years.
    - Russia is one of the world's largest exporters of oil with the United States importing more than 600,000 barrels per day. Russian oil represents more than a third of Europe's total imports.

- International Payments
    - Banks largely cannot hold money extra territorially directly, for most useful values of “directly.” Instead, they rely on a correspondent banking relationship.
    - Banks can have accounts at other banks, and extremely frequently do. A major reason to do this internationally is to facilitate payments in other currencies and other jurisdictions.
    - SWIFT: The world’s most expensive encrypted messaging service
    - SWIFT is almost synonymous with international wires because it is the primary way that banks and their correspondents choose to inter operate with respect to wires
    -  Specifically, they send a MT 103 message, which is a bit longer than a tweet, and then each bank operates their internal books and other banking systems to make the request encoded in the message a reality (or fail gracefully) 
 

- Gold only has value, if “gold whales” (=central banks) aren’t selling it.

- "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man."--Heraclitus

- Crude oil 
    -  Depending on its chemical composition, crude oil can be either “sweet” or “sour” depending on its sulfur content; or “heavy” or “light” depending on its gravity (i.e. whether it is heavier or lighter than water). These distinctions matter because re neries can only process one type of crude oil at a time. The process of converting them to handle another can take between months and years. Even if another re nery was available that could process the oil, it might not have sufficient capacity to handle the additional throughput.

    - Natural gas -  cheapest way to transport natural gas is by pipeline. Overseas transport is an expensive and technologically challenging process due to the need to liquefy and then re-gasify the natural gas. Oil, by contrast, can be shipped on land or sea in whatever form is required without the need for pressurized containers. For that reason, most producers and consumers of natural gas depend on long-term contracts that lock in prices for the latter (usually linked to oil but o en at a discount) and amortize the cost of constructing and maintaining pipelines for the former. 

- Innovation at Companies 
    - Slow down to innovate
    - "Good ideas can get trapped inside big companies because they're not staffed to succeed. The challenge at any established company is that the demands of your core business will always soak up all of the bandwidth of your leaders."
    - Your process for finding new product ideas should come down to this: What helps you make the right decision to take
    the next step and figure out if A) this is the customer problem you want to solve, and B) this is the customer experience that solves that problem?
    - If you can't describe something that sounds compelling and that people really want and need in a one-page press release, then there's no point in building it.
    - Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do.
    -You can't get to a place where you don't know if your business was better this week than it was last week or this quarter over last quarter — otherwise, it will continue to get worse, undetected.

- Russian History   
    - Post Soviet breakup, two harward economists (Shliefer and sacks) were enlisted as advisors by Russian Govt. (Chuikov) as advisors for privatization
    - One of these advisors faced lawsuit for conflict of interest and had to settle it out of court. 
    - This privatization gave rise to Oligarch. Majority of these oligarchs are jewish

- GeoPolitics
    - Post Soviet breakup, Russia started privatization with 2 russian-american jewish harvard professors (Shleifer and sacks) as advisors
    - Shleifer's involvement with both Harvard and the Russian government culminated many years later in a conflict of interest scandal involving personal gains from investments in Russian securities. After an investigation, both Harvard and Shleifer were forced to pay fines in 2005 to bring the matter to an end.
    - This privatization gave rise to russian oligarchs

    - You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others.
    - when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some.
    - finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy
    - Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a bother about what’s truly bother worthy.
    - The life itself is a form of suffering
    - Two ways people think about their problems, 
        - Denial. Some people deny that their problems exist in the first place. And because they deny reality, they must constantly delude or distract themselves from reality. This may make them feel good in the short term, but it leads to a life of insecurity, neuroticism, and emotional repression.
        - Victim Mentality. Some choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems, even when they in fact could. Victims seek to blame others for their problems or
        blame outside circumstances. This may make them feel better in the short term, but it leads to a life of anger, helplessness, and despair.
    - Highs - Whether it’s a substance like alcohol, the moral righteousness that comes from blaming
    others, or the thrill of some new risky adventure, highs are shallow and unproductive ways to go about one’ life.Highs also generate addiction. The more you rely on them to feel better about your underlying problems, the more you will seek them out.
    - Everything comes with inherent sacrifice

        - Market has become Efficient compared to 60 years back
        - Access to data, live feeds have enabled many people to become smart at investing
        - Emotion is the greatest enemy of superior investing. 
        - In 2022, readily available quantitative information about the present cannot be the road to superior performance, most people, they should invest through others. Whether it’s an index fund, an ETF, or an actively managed account. We don’t do our own legal work, dental work, medical work, we don’t fix our own cars. Why should we manage our own money? Why should we believe that we have the ability as part-timers to do that? So the amateur should basically pick funds and managers, in my opinions.you want to go into a global fund that includes China under their charter. 

- Payments industry 
    - The process by which a business discerns that some money has the colour of revenue is called revenue recognition.

- CBDC (Central bank Digital Currency)
    - Database maintained by Central Bank 
    - Like cash, it would not earn any interest
    - only way to have account with RBI
    - Crypto is de-centralized (so to say), CBDC is not 
    - It can be programmed for restricted use like destination bound (as food coupons),or being time bound etc.
    - Dollar reserves of RBI - Only onshore US banks can have these dollars and not RBI. Every central bank has account with one of these banks. US is aware of all international transactions happening in Dollars. 
    - CBDC can potentially be used as alternative to USD with RBI acting as banker. India is Well placed for this because it has consistent current account deficit.

    - Consistent Hashing - Used to distribute requests/data efficiently and evenly across servers. One way to distribute hash keys across servers in a range. Lets say, given SHA-1 algorithm for hashing, we find out min (i.e. 0) and max of this algorithm and then allocate keys across servers in this range.

- Human Psychology
    - Uncertainty is the root of all progress and all growth. As the old adage goes, the man who believes he knows everything learns nothing
    - Work expands so as to fill up the time available for its completion

- Joel Greenblatt's wisdom
    - 1. Understand incentives -Companies are run by people. Understand how the top management is being motivated.  Out of their total package, how much compensation is fixed and variable? Do they see their companies as their life's work or just another "job"?
    2. Don't sell too early - If a company is performing well and its valuation is sensible, never sell it. (I'll probably sell a bit to feel good, but I'll keep the bulk.)We have our blind spots. Overcome it by sharing our thesis with others and listening to feedback.
    3. The hard part - focusing on easy companies  - Simplicity is key. Invest in what we can understand well so we can succeed. In investing, it's about the returns we can generate -- not how complex our ideas are.
    4. Control our emotions and do proper valuation work.= Take control of our emotions when we're investing. Don't take the shortcut, do proper work on valuations. Valuation work acts as an anchor during volatile markets.
    5.  Focus on normalised earnings When Wall Street is short-sighted, it is easy to outperform just by being a long term investor. Focus on the bigger picture.If a high-quality business is facing short term challenges that are not fatal, give it a break. Stay vested.
    6. Less leverage the better - we could be right in our analysis but short-term prices may disagree -- causing temporary negative losses.  If we're leveraged up, we may potentially suffer from a margin call before we're proven right.
    7. Mr Market will eventually get it right = In the short term, the stock market is terrible at valuing businesses.  That is your opportunity. But in the long term, if your company is worth its weight, it will be reflected in its share price. 

- US Taxation
    -  if you buy stocks in your 401(k) tax-advantaged retirement account, and you sell them to buy other stocks in the 401(k), you don’t pay taxes; a 401(k) defers taxes until you take money out at retirement.
    - if you buy shares in a mutual fund, and they go up, and you don’t sell, you might have to pay taxes anyway. A mutual fund pools your money with many other people’s money and buys a bunch of stocks for all of you. And if the mutual fund sells stocks, it incurs capital gains taxes, which it passes on to its holders. Roughly speaking what this means is that if you invest in a mutual fund, and it goes up, and you don’t sell, but other investors in the mutual fund do sell, then you have to pay taxes. (As do they.) One reason people like to invest in exchange- traded funds is that this rule is weird and the ETF business has found ways to avoid it.

-  a cyclical is a company that will prosper in good times and suffer in bad. That's because it makes or sells expensive products or luxury items that customers can put off buying when they are short on cash. People continue to buy deodorant, dental floss, Big Macs, and headache pills no matter what, which is why drugstores and fast-food restaurants are not cyclicals.
- The best time to get involved with cyclicals is when the economy is at its weakest, earnings are at their lowest, and public sentiment is at its bleakest.

- Behavioural Psychology 
    - absolute freedom, by itself, means nothing.
    - Travel is a fantastic self development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves
    - Appearances and salesmanship became more advantageous forms of expression in a society where there existed an abundance of economic opportunity
    - There is such pressure in the West to be likable that people often reconfigure their entire personality depending on the person they’re dealing with.
    - Rejection makes your life better. if we reject nothing (perhaps in fear of being rejected by something ourselves), we essentially have no identity at all.
    - The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement
    - Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other’s support.
    - People in a healthy relationship with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems and not take responsibility for their partner’s values and problems.
    - Entitled people expect other people to take responsibility of their problem or they take too much responsibility for other people's problems.
    - The setting of proper boundaries doesn’t mean you can’t help or support your partner or be helped and supported yourself. You both should support each other. But only because you choose to support and be supported. Not because you feel obligated or entitled.
    - People with strong boundaries are not afraid of a temper tantrum, an argument, or getting hurt.People with weak boundaries are terrified of those things and will constantly mold their own behavior to fit the highs and lows of their relational emotional roller coaster
    - People with strong boundaries, 
        - It’s unreasonable to expect two people to accommodate each other 100 percent and fulfill every need the other has.
        - They may hurt someone’s feelings sometimes, but ultimately they can’t determine how other people feel.
        - A healthy relationship is not about controlling one another’s emotions, but rather about each partner supporting the other in their individual growth and in solving their own problems.
    - When we’re overloaded with opportunities and options, we suffer from what psychologists refer to as the paradox of choice. Basically, the more options we’re given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose, because we’re aware of all the other options we’re potentially forfeiting.

- Stock Markets
    - Peter Lynch on Stock Markets "Some event will come out of left field, and the market will go down, or the market will go up. Volatility will occur. Markets will continue to have these ups and downs. … Basic corporate profits have grown about 8% a year historically. So, corporate profits double about every nine years. The stock market ought to double about every nine years. So I think — the market is about 3,800 today, or 3,700 — I'm pretty convinced the next 3,800 points will be up; it won't be down. The next 500 points, the next 600 points — I don’t know which way they’ll go. So, the market ought to double in the next eight or nine years. They’ll double again in eight or nine years after that. Because profits go up 8% a year, and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it."

- Energy
    - Synthesis of the ammonia needed to produce nitrogenous fertilizers now depends heavily on natural gas as the source of hydrogen
    - There could be no natural gas–powered flight, as the energy density of methane is three orders of magnitude lower than that of aviation kerosene, and also no coal-powered flight—the density difference is not that large, but coal would not flow from wing tanks to engines.
    - Crude oil needs refining to separate the complex mixture of hydrocarbons into specific fuels—gasoline being the lightest; residual fuel oil the heaviest.

    - Tactical- Maint to be used in battle. 
    - Strategic - More as a deterrent. they are Weapons of mass destruction

- Electricity/Energy
    -  it is still impossible to store electricity affordably in quantities sufficient to meet the demand of a medium-sized city (500,000 people) for only a week or two, or to supply a megacity (more than 10 million people) for just half a day.
    - Electricity is the best form of energy for lighting: it has no competitor on any scale of private or public illumination, and very few innovations have produced such an impact on modern civilization as has the ability to remove the limits of daylight and to illuminate the night.
    -  A nuclear renaissance would be particularly helpful if we cannot develop better ways of large-scale electricity storage soon. 
    - modern nuclear reactors, if properly built and carefully run, offer safe, long lasting, and highly reliable ways of electricity generation; as already noted, they are able to operate more than 90 percent of the time, and their lifespan can exceed 40 years.
    -  batteries, compressed air, and supercapacitors, still have capacities orders of magnitude lower than needed by large cities, even for a single day’s worth of storage.
    - Nitrogen is needed in such great quantities because it is in every living cell: it is in chlorophyll, whose excitation powers photosynthesis; in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, which store and process all genetic information; and in amino acids, which make up all theproteins required for the growth and maintenance of our tissues.The element is abundan —it makes up nearly 80 percent of the atmosphere, organisms live submerged in it—and yet it is a key limiting factor in crop productivity as well as in human growth. This is one of the great paradoxical realities of the biosphere and its explanation is simple: nitrogen exists in the atmosphere as a non-reactive molecule (N2), and only a few natural processes can split the bond between the two nitrogen atoms and make the element available to form reactive compounds.
    -  Old way to enrich soil with  nitrogen stores was to collect and apply human and animal wastes

        - Way of exporting to US and earning dollars is no more going to work smoothly.

- Lee Kuan Yew (LKY) of Singapore 
	- relentless determination to follow the facts where they lead
	-  a pattern of initial tight control, caution, and centralized planning, followed by a slow move towards a freer economy as long as everything seemed to be working 
    - insist that state-run corporations stay in the black or shut down. As they succeeded, they privatized--telecommunications, the port, and public utilities all started within the government and became independent profitabable companies over time
	- We noted by the 1970s that when governments undertook primary responsibility for the basic duties of the head of a family, the drive in people weakened. Welfare undermined self-reliance. People did not have to work for their families' well-being. The handout became a way of life. The downward spiral was relentless as motivation and productivity went down. People lost the drive to achieve because they paid too.much in taxes. They became dependent on the state for their basic needs.
	- constant tinkering and fine-tuning around incentive systems is core to LKY's planning.
	- Taxation in Singapore 
		- Top Tax rate is 22%
		- Corporate tax rate is 17%
		- No capital gains tax
		- 7% GST 
		- No duty on imports
		- no inheritance/estate tax
	-  The freedom of the press was the freedom of its owners to advance their personal and class interests.
	-  the Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) published an alleged defamatory article and had sales restricted, the AWSJ offered to distribute its journal free to its deprived subscribers to "forego its sales revenue in the spirit of helping Singapore businessmen". Singapore's government agreed, as long as it left out advertisements. The paper backed out, claiming cost issues. Singapore offered to cover half the additional costs. When the paper refused, Singapore gave an official response: "You are not interested in the business community getting information. You want the freedom to make money selling advertisements."
	- 75 percent of Singaporeans are Chinese.
	- On Minority communities, 
		- Every solution on the table, go for the most direct and efficient way to achieve a goal, push forward regardless of decorum.More compelling was his emphasis on working with and through minority government members each time he worked with minority communities.
         -  From experience, we knew that govt. officials could not reach out to minority parents and students in the way their own community leaders did. The respect these leaders enjoyed and their sincere interest in the welfare of the less successful persuaded parents and children to make the effort. Paid bureaucrats could never have the same commitment, zest, and rapport to move parents and their children. ...On such personal-emotional issues involving ethnic and family pride, only leaders of the wider ethnic family can reach out to the parents and their children.
		-  LKY's approach blends traditional, family values and blunt realism easy to associate with the right with a determination to work with affected minorities and concern for their welfare that pattern-matches more clearly to the left. That mixture of familiarity and foreignness in his approach, and that tension between traditional and progressive values, is one reason this work was so refreshing for me, coming from a US background.
	- Education and birthrate typically have an inverse correlation.
		-  Provide preferential school selection for children of graduate mothers who have at least three kids.
		- Establish a government matchmaking system to "facilitate socializing between men and women graduates"
	- pay for performance over time on job.
	- On Trade Unions
		- Strict laws and tough talk alone could not have achieved this. It was our overall policy that convinced our workers and union leaders... but ultimately it was the trust and confidence they had in me, gained over long years of association, that helped transform industrial relations from one of militancy and confrontation to cooperation and partnership. 
        - The key to peace and harmony in society is a sense of fair play, that everyone has a share in the fruits of our progress

- Life lessons, 
	- Sometimes getting what you want is as simple as asking for it. Closed mouths don’t get fed.
	- Talk to strangers—in the grocery store, at the airport, in line at the DMV—you'll meet cool people, have great stories to tell, and maybe even make a lonely person's day.
	- It's cheap and easy to keep your home neat and clean. The positive mental benefits are enormous.
	- On that note, cleaning is easy when you do it often. Wiping up a recent spill takes two seconds. Scraping dried spaghetti sauce from the counter takes too long.
	- No coffee after noon and no alcohol at least four hours before bed improves sleep dramatically.
	- Drink more water. 
	- Publish content online. It's a creative outlet. It's fun to watch your work improve. It's a magnet for interesting people you’d otherwise never meet.
	- Money spent on books is money well spent. Even if you only read some, you're getting more knowledge and entertainment than you're paying for.
	- Spend more time working on mobility. You'll have fewer injuries. You'll feel better. As you get older, you'll maintain a higher quality of life for longer.

	- Get comfortable sitting alone in silence. It’s something you'll need to practice. Put away your phone, pour a cup of coffee, and sit in a quiet place. Turn off the radio on your next long car ride. Allow yourself to be alone with your thoughts.

	- Have more patience, especially with your parents. If anyone deserves your patience, it's the people who had to live with you during your most annoying years.

	- Spend long weekends with good friends. Living together—even for a few days—deepens bonds and strengthens friendships. Life gets busy, and it's easy to not do this, but the dividends the relationship will pay throughout your life is worth the small time investment now.

	- Make a habit of forming habits. They are the building blocks of the person you want to become. The best way to build a habit is to start smaller than you think you can accomplish, then work up.

	- Bring your lunch to work, especially in your 20s. The compound interest lost from the money you spent on lunch is a terrible waste.

	- Early in your career you should optimize for one of three things: making a lot of money, building a marketable skill, or doing something you love. My preference is for the first. If you make a lot of money and invest it wisely, you'll be able to pursue your passions while you're still young—without having to worry about finances.

	- Write handwritten thank you notes. It takes five minutes and means a lot to the recipients, especially if they’re older.

	- When it comes to clothing, fit is more important than fashion. A $10 t-shirt that fits you perfectly looks better than a $90 dress shirt that's baggy and loose in the arms.

	- When you're planning anything, take the amount of time you think you’ll need and double it. Tasks usually take longer than you expect, and it's good to build in a buffer. Underpromise and overdeliver, even if it's just for yourself.

	- There's value in sticking with one job for a long period of time—you'll get really good at it, your confidence will increase, you'll become specialized which is rewarded financially if it's in the right area. But there's also value in jumping around—bigger salary increases, bigger network, potentially broader base of skills, more unique experiences. Neither way is wrong, you just have to be clear with yourself about what you want.

	- Setting reasonable expectations is a superpower. If you consistently underpromise and over deliver, people will always be happy with you.

	- On the other side, never agree to something you're not positive you can do. People generally don't care if you say no in the first place. They'll get really mad if you say yes and then let them down.

	- Your possessions increase to fill the amount of space you have. And possessions tend to be more burdensome than liberating. Before moving to a larger space, think about it deliberately. With each additional possession you purchase, ask yourself, “do I really need this thing?”

	- One of the biggest wins in life is finding the things you REALLY care about, and then only focusing on those things. This won’t be easy at first, but if you filter all your decisions through the question, "Does this get me closer to or further from the things I REALLY care about?" you'll continuously move your life in a direction that makes you happy. Auditing the decisions you make, and ensuring they're aligned with the things that bring you the most joy, is one of the most important habits you can build. Do I really care about driving this car that costs me $600/month? No, I'd be happy with a car that costs $200/month. But I do really care about this family vacation every year, and reducing my car payment by $400/month helps me pay for the vacation.

	- Do I really care about watching this thing I'm watching on TV right now? No, I wouldn't care at all if I missed it. But I do really care about getting better at playing the guitar. Cutting out the hour of TV I watch every night makes more room for guitar practice. 

	- Marriage is for making things work. Dating is for finding the best person to make things work with. When you break up, break up. Don’t stay friends. Don’t take a break. Move on. Delete their social media. Block their number. Forget about them. It hurts at first and it’s easier to drag things out, but you’ll feel better faster if you don’t.

	- People will use jargon and complicated language to make you think they're smart. But the smartest people you'll ever meet will speak so simply that you’ll underestimate their intelligence. This is because it takes an immense amount of intelligence and mastery to explain complicated topics in a simple way. If you don't have this level of mastery, you can either admit it (most people won't) or you can confuse people with big words and complicated phrases until they stop asking questions. 

	- When you meet a jargon junkie, you can expose them by persistently asking simple questions and maintaining your composure. But the more mature you become, the less likely you’ll be to do this. Instead, you’ll start to feel bad for these people.

	- Relatedly, the most insecure people you meet will often be the loudest. Confident people don't need to draw attention to themselves. Insecure people do. They are compensating for a lack of confidence or competence. It's meant to be a distraction so people don't "find them out."

	- The biggest difference between this observation and #25 is intelligence level. This tactic will more often be used by people with lesser education or lower intelligence. The previous tactic will be used by people with higher education or intelligence. 

	- Cell phones are best used resourcefully, not reflexively.

	- Pull out your cell phone when you have a specific task to complete—you need directions, you have to make a call, you want to listen to music—not when you have time to kill. 

	- My experience with cell phone scrolling is that it results in two things: dissatisfaction and anxiety. People say you never regret a workout, well, the opposite is true with a scroll session: you always regret it.

	- Avoid complainers at all costs.

	- Complaining is more contagious than COVID, and it's more deadly.

		Being a complainer means you always find the bad in a situation rather than the good. You often find an excuse rather than a solution. And your overall mood and wellbeing will suffer.

		Being around complainers makes you more likely to complain. It kills morale and productivity in teams. It limits your potential.

		As a manager, do not tolerate complaining on your team. As a parent, don't complain in front of your children, and respond to their complaints with the positive side of the situation. As an adult, be direct with your friends and family members. Tell them you don't tolerate complaining. The sooner you eliminate it from your life, the happier and more successful you will be.

		When people perpetually have "bad luck," it's usually not bad luck. It's the result of their perpetually poor decisions. Identify these people and avoid them.

		- One heuristic to tell how good someone is at making decisions is by how much time they have. The busiest people are often the ones who make the worst decisions. Busy people spend a lot of time correcting poor decisions. And because they’re so busy correcting past decisions, they don’t have time to make good decisions. - Shane Parrish

	- The best time to do everything was ten years ago—investing, exercising, learning a new skill, etc. Talk with older people you respect and ask what they wish they had started doing in their 20s, then start doing that thing immediately. It's rarely too late, but it's always better to start sooner rather than later.

	W- aking up naturally, without an alarm, is a great feeling. Creating a consistent routine is one way to do this. Freeing yourself from work obligations is another. I recommend pursuing both. 

	- You have to take calculated financial risks to see large increases in your net worth. I bought and sold investment properties leading to about a 15% increase in my net worth. I bought crypto which also increased my net worth by about 15%. I started a company that never made money and cost me about 6% of my net worth. Two wins and one loss, but the wins significantly outweighed the loss. The key is calculated risks. In each of the above ventures, I knew my absolute worst case scenario—my downside was capped. I also predicted potential upside in each case and determined the potential upside outweighed the potential downside. You won't be right every time, but if you take calculated risks, you should be right more often than you're wrong.

	- Think about starting a lot of businesses. You won’t follow through on most of them, but the act of thinking through a big idea is a special type of exercise most people don't do often (or ever).

	- One of the biggest secrets of fitness is avoiding injury. If you're healthy, you can exercise consistently. If you can exercise consistently, compounding will do its work. To avoid injury, tame your ego. There's rarely any reason to push past 85%, and if you don't, you're less likely to get injured.
	- Seek advice from everyone, but filter it to fit your life. The purpose of asking for advice is to gain as much perspective as possible then make your own decision with that perspective, not to get someone else to make your decision for you.
	- Good enough and done is better than perfect but imagined. 
	- So much of the technology we lose our patience with today would've looked like magic ten years ago. Remember this when your phone is taking too long to play a YouTube video while you’re sitting on the beach.
	- If you're constantly busy, you have underlying issues to address.
	- If someone is bothering you, it's your fault until you've told them.
	- If you aren't absolutely thrilled to watch it, turn off the TV and pick up a book instead. 
	- Get on the dance floor at every wedding. Nobody cares if you're bad at dancing. They're too concerned about how bad they are. Plus, the more people on the dance floor, the more fun the wedding. Consider it your gift to the newlyweds. 
	- Set rules for yourself. They make life better 95% of the time. Then break them 5% of the time.
	- Spend less time checking boxes and more time building relationships. Checking boxes brings a certain level of success, but relationships bring fulfillment and opportunity you'll never find on your own.
	- Buy a nice suit in your 20s and never let yourself outgrow it.
	- Pick one or two hobbies you love and spend time getting better at them. Seeing yourself progress through deliberate practice is a confidence builder and a satisfaction booster.
	- Spend enough time alone that you're comfortable doing it. Enjoying your own company is a wonderful gift to give yourself. 

- During times of abundance, worldviews don’t get tested very strongly and people are shielded from the consequences of being inaccurate. It’s during the times of scarcity that reality reasserts itself and filters out the workable from the unworkable worldviews.

- Processed food - A lack of taste memory is one reason why Coca-Cola is such a profitable business. The recipe is engineered to not come with a taste memory, which is why the drink is so addicting. Cheetos are similar. According to the food scientist Steven Witherly, they bring so much pleasure because of the way each puff melts in your mouth. The way the food melts in the mouth is known as “vanishing caloric density,” which makes your brain think there are no calories in the food, which is why you can eat them for so long.

- World's dependence on Fossil fuels, 
    - our food supply—be it staple grains, clucking birds, favorite vegetables, or seafood praised for its nutritious quality—has become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels.
    - Eating meat has been as significant a component of our evolutionary heritage as our large brains (which evolved partly because of meat eating), bipedalism, and symbolic language.

    - Ammonia is used as dominant nitrogen fertilizer.Ammonia is a simple inorganic compound of one nitrogen and three hydrogens (NH3), which means that nitrogen makes up 82 percent of its mass.Nitrates are also used to produce explosives.natural gas is used as the source of hydrogen, and  efficient centrifugal compressors and better catalysts are used in process to produce ammonia. synthetic nitrogen feeds half of humanity—or, everything else being equal, half of the world’s population could not be sustained without synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.About 80 percent of global ammonia production is used to fertilize crops; the rest is used to make nitric acid, explosives, rocket propellants, dyes, fibers, and window and floor cleaners.

- [Power stocks][Stocks] 
    - if you’re buying power stocks at p/b of 3x you deserve to lose money. NTPC was 3x in 2011, thereafter it was flat for a decade excl. dividend. power stocks can’t earn more than cost of capital, so better to buy them at book or below book value. or not buy them at all.


- Four indispensable materials to modern civilization - cement, steel, plastics, and ammonia.
    - Steel - Modern steels are made from cast iron by reducing its high carbon content to 0.08–2.1 percent by weight.Steel’s typical tensile strength is about seven times that of aluminum and nearly four times that of copper; its hardness is, respectively, four and eight times higher; and it is heat resistant—aluminum melts at 660oC, copper at 1,085oC, steel only at 1,425oC. Iron is the Earth’s dominant element by mass because it is heavy (nearly eight times as heavy as water) and because it forms the planet’s core. But it is also abundant in the Earth’s crust: only three elements (oxygen, silicon, and aluminum) are more common; iron, with nearly 6 percent, ranks fourth.    
        - Steel manufacturing process -  The process starts with blast furnaces (tall iron and steel structures lined with heat-resistant materials) that produce liquid (cast or pig) iron by smelting iron ore, coke, and limestone.74 The second step—reducing cast iron’s high carbon content and producing steel—takes place in a BOF (basic oxygen furnace; the adjective refers to the chemical properties of the produced slag). 

    - Plastic - Plastics are a large group of synthetic (or semisynthetic) organic materials whose commonquality is that they are fit for forming (molding). The malleability of plastics makes it possible to form them by casting, pressing, or extruding, and they create shapes ranging from thin film to heavy-duty pipes and from feather-light bottles to massive and sturdy waste containers. Global output has been dominated by thermoplastics—polymers that soften readily when heated and harden again when cooled. 
    
    - Cement - Cement is the indispensable component of concrete, and it is produced by heating (to at least 1,450oC) ground limestone (a source of calcium) and clay, shale, or waste materials (sources of silicon, aluminum, and iron) in large kilns—long (100–220 meters) inclined metal cylinders.79 This high-temperature sintering produces clinker (fused limestone and aluminosilicates) that is ground to yield fine, powdery cement. 

    - A typical lithium car battery weighing about 450 kilograms contains about 11 kilograms of lithium, nearly 14 kilograms of cobalt, 27 kilograms of nickel, more than 40 kilograms of copper, and 50 kilograms of graphite—as well as about 181 kilograms of steel, aluminum, and plastics. Supplying these materials for a single vehicle requires processing about 40 tons of ores, and given the low concentration of many elements in their ores it necessitates extracting and processing about 225 tons of raw materials. 
    
- Equity Investments 
    - Direct indexing, investors own a benchmark’s underlying shares. That is, while index-fund owners possess one investment, those who index directly typically hold dozens or even hundreds of securities, depending upon whether they fully replicate an index, or only sample it. 

- Tech 
    - Approach to migration from one to another cloud
        - Set up haproxy, nginx or similar as reverse proxy and carefully decide if you can handle retries on failed queries. If you want true zero-downtime migration there's a challenge here in making sure you have a setup that lets you add and remove backends transparently. There are many ways of doing this of various complexity. I've tended to favour using dynamic dns updates for this; in this specific instance we used Hashicorp's Consul to keep dns updated w/services. I've also used ngx_mruby for instances where I needed more complex backend selection (allows writing Ruby code to execute within nginx)

        - Set up a VPN (or more depending on your networking setup) between the locations so that the reverse proxy can reach backends in both/all locations, and so that the backends can reach databases both places.

      - Replicate the database to the new location.

        - Ensure your app has a mechanism for determining which database to use as the master. Just as for the reverse proxy we used Consul to select. All backends would switch on promoting a replica to master.

        - Ensure you have a fast method to promote a database replica to a master. You don't want to be in a situation of having to fiddle with this. We had fully automated scripts to do the failover.

        - Ensure your app gracefully handles database failure of whatever it thinks the current master is. This is the trickiest bit in some cases, as you either need to make sure updates are idempotent, or you need to make sure updates during the switchover either reliably fail or reliably succeed. In the case I mentioned we were able to safely retry requests, but in many cases it'll be safer to just punt on true zero downtime migration assuming your setup can handle promotion of the new master fast enough (in our case the promotion of the new Postgres master took literally a couple of seconds, during which any failing updates would just translate to some page loads being slow as they retried, but if we hadn't been able to retry it'd have meant a few seconds downtime).

        - Once you have the new environment running and capable of handling requests (but using the database in the old environment):

        - Reduce DNS record TTL.

        - Ensure the new backends are added to the reverse proxy. You should start seeing requests flow through the new backends and can verify error rates aren't increasing. This should be quick to undo if you see errors.

        - Update DNS to add the new environment reverse proxy. You should start seeing requests hit the new reverse proxy, and some of it should flow through the new backends. Wait to see if any issues.

        - Promote the replica in the new location to master and verify everything still works. Ensure whatever replication you need from the new master works. You should now see all database requests hitting the new master.

        - Drain connections from the old backends (remove them from the pool, but leave them running until they're not handling any requests). You should now have all traffic past the reverse proxy going via the new environment.

        - Update DNS to remove the old environment reverse proxy. Wait for all traffic to stop hitting the old reverse proxy.

        - When you're confident everything is fine, you can disable the old environment and bring DNS TTL back up.

- 3D Printers - There are broadly two types of 3D printers in common use. One uses thermoplastic filament sourced from a spool and extruded through a heated nozzle attached to a gantry with three axes of motion to build a printed object from the build plate on upwards. This was the first widely commercial available 3D printing technology for home or small business use, and while it has a lot to recommend it for many applications, it did not take off for the miniature use case. The other type of 3D printer is a resin printer, which are a technological marvel of chemistry and hardware design. 3D printer resins are liquid photoplastics; they cure (harden) in the presence of UV light. An LCD screen beneath the transparent bottom of a vat of ooze exposes a layer 30-50 microns thick to harden it; a single- dimensional screw then rotates to pull the build plate upwards (to remove it from the film) then downwards (to get more liquid resin stuck to the newly-solid layer then re-adhere to the film). The process then repeats until the print is done, in something a calculus teacher might describe as integration by parts and that a timelapse videographer might describe as absolutely mesmerizing.

- Markets - Most of the return of the stock market over time comes from a few high- performing “superstocks.” More than 95% of all stocks, over their lifetime as public companies, collectively don’t even outperform cash, and more than half deliver negative returns, In the long run, the odds of making money in the stock market as a whole are very high—but the odds of making money in any single stock are low.

- HDFC Bank's business model, 
    - Focus on Commercial banking i.e. lending to companies.
    - Offering services to India's cooperative banks to speed up their cheque processing as long as they maintained interest free deposits at the bank
    - electronic processing system for funds that ran alongside the stock settlement
    system, winning them the cash management business of an entire ecosystem of capital
    markets participants.
    - Lower costs of deposits by maintaining high CASA ratio (the ratio of lower cost current account and savings account deposits at a bank to total
    deposits.)

- On Signals, 
    - status is associated with use of jargon. PhD students at lower-ranked universities used more linguistic complexity in their dissertation titles compared to students at higher-ranked schools.
    - The logic of buried signals is that people with lots of positive attributes can afford to be modest because odds are at least one of their good traits will be uncovered. People with only one particular strength will be eager to show it, because it's all they have.
    - But most people can’t counter signal. If you’re already a highly respected person, countersignaling can convey positive information about you. If you are not, then countersignaling might backfire. low-status people who countersignal lower their status even more. But high-status people who countersignal increase their status even more.

- Propaganda
-  the purpose of propaganda is not limited just to instilling desired beliefs. Often, demonstrating the regime’s strength, capacity, and resources to intimidate people is a more important goal.

- Peter lynch
    -  A general rule for investing in restaurants is that annual sales should exceed the cost of construction.I'm skittish about owning stock in restaurants that make most of their money on liquor. Liquor tastes the same everywhere, and a restaurant that becomes a bar is likely to lose its customers to a trendier bar.

-  We think we’re better than we really are because it’s good for our self-esteem and it keeps us from becoming a bunch of dreary downers. Princeton psychologist Daniel Kahneman is fond of saying that if we could accurately assess how risky our actions are, we’d probably never do anything; we’d be too depressed.While positive thinking can be useful, unrealistic optimism is not. The reality is that your odds of beating the market over time are no better than one in four, and they’re probably worse. And chasing hot funds, or hot stocks, in a frenzied attempt to beat the market is the best way I know of to get burned — or turned off investing entirely. 

- Economics 
    - Marginal Utility theory - Each dollar we have gives us some benefit. Some "utility". But the MORE money we have, the LESS benefit we derive from each *additional* $1.
    - Expected *Utility* Maximization may be a much better strategy than Expectation Maximization. For example, if we're worth $2M, and we use $1M of it to play this game, our optimal strategy may be to stop after 6 doubles:


- Software - Outage Incident Management
    - Incident Handling:

    - Have a runbook for disaster recovery and black swan events. Expect the unexpected, and plan for how you will respond, assess, and communicate.

    - Follow your own runbook of disaster recovery. Atlassian published their disaster recovery runbook for Confluence, and yet, did not follow this runbook. Their runbook states that any runbook has communication and escalation guidelines. Either the company did not have communication guidelines, or they did not follow these. A bad look, either way.

    - Communicate directly and transparently. Atlassian did none of this until 9 days. This lack of communication eroded a huge amount of trust not just across impacted customers, but anyone being aware of the outage. While Atlassian might have assumed it is safe to not say anything: this is the worst choice to make. Take note of how transparent GitLab or Cloudflare communicates during outages - both of them publicly traded companies, just like Atlassian.

    - Speak your customer’s language. Atlassian status updates were vague, and lacked all technical details. However, their customers were not business people. They were Head of ITs and CTOs who made the choice to buy Atlassian products… and could now not answer what the problem with the system was. By dumbing down messaging, Atlassian put their biggest sponsors - the technical people! - in an impossible situation to defend the company. If the company sees customer churn, I greatly attribute it to this mistake.

    - An executive taking public ownership of the outage. It took until Day 9 for a C-level to acknowledge this outage. Again, at companies which developers trust, this happens almost immediately. Executives not issuing a statement signals the issue is too small for them to care about it.

    - Reach out directly to customers, and talk to them. Customers did not feel heard during this outage and had no human talk to them. They were left with automated messages. During a black swan event, mobilize people to talk directly to customers - you can do this without impacting the mitigation effort.

    - Avoid status updates that say nothing. The majority of status updates on the incident page were copy-pasting the same update. Atlassian clearly did this to provide updates every few hours… but these were not updates. They added to the feeling that the company did not have the outage under control.

    - Avoid radio silence. Up to Day 9, Atlassian has been on radio silence. Avoid this approach at all costs. 

- [Investing][PersonalFinance] 
    -  The whole point of investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough money to reach your own goals. The best way to measure your investing success is not by whether you’re beating the market but by whether your investments are growing steadily and rapidly enough to get you where you want to go. That means that staying put, in an index fund or even in a fund that is underperforming the S&P by a point or two, is better than climbing onto the whizzing treadmill of trying to beat the market.

- Social media effect 
    - 24/7 access to social media has over-socialized us. Every action is criticized, every sentence is scrutinized until soon, we get stuck in a prison of fear and risk-aversion. Plus, the Internet has a perfect memory. It only takes one tweet to end your career and permanently tarnish your Google search results.

- "Poison pill" in US against hostile acquisition 
    - In the U.S., the board has a powerful tool in this fight. It is the poison pill. (Everyone calls it that, though its technical legal name is a “shareholder rights plan.”) The board of directors of a company, feeling threatened by a big acquirer of its stock or a corporate raider proposing to buy the company, will adopt a “shareholder rights plan.” The gist of the plan is that if anyone — meaning, basically, the buyer — acquires more than X% of the company’s stock (often X is 15 or 20), then that person’s shares go poof. You can’t actually do that — you can’t make one shareholder’s shares go poof — but you can get arbitrarily close by allowing all of the other shareholders of the company to buy many more shares at a discount, or by giving them more shares for free. So you say “if anyone goes above 15% of the stock, then we will distribute one free share of stock for each existing share, except that the person who went above 15% doesn’t get any of the free stock.” So if someone gets 15%, then everyone else’s shares get doubled, taking the acquirer down to about 8%.[2] (In theory you could do this repeatedly, so that the acquirer could never get a controlling stake.)

- [Peter Lynch on Banks][PersonalFinance]
    - The common measure of a bank's profitability is return on assets. You get the ROA by dividing the bank's income by its assets over a specified period. A 1 percent ROA is average, and that's a good benchmark to use. Anything above that is a plus. Another useful measure is the price- to-earnings ratio. I look for thrifts with p/e ratios below 10. I'd be wary of investing in any thrift that is losing money (zero or negative earnings) at the time it goes public. 
        - Less than 0.5% of NPA is comforting 
        - If a bank owns its own branches, it's a plus. Real estate is carried on the books at cost and can be a valuable hidden asset.Another plus is what bankers call cheap deposits. A bank that has few branches and large concentrations of deposits tends to be more cost effective than one with many branches and smaller deposits.

- [Peter Lynch on Momentum][PersonalFinance] 
    - Stocks on the way down usually don't hit bottom until the volume has subsided. Heavy volume in the upward direction is often a harbinger of more big moves.

        - Establish clear requirement for Modernization in terms of business value 
        - Break the problem into smaller parts 
        - Successfully deliver parts 
        - Change the organization to allow this to happen 

- [Assessing business Value in Architecture][SystemArchitecture]
    - Value stream mapping of business processes,
        - examining how each part of a customer journey impacts revenue and margin.
        - how a business process or improvement in it helps in customer retention
        - How business is impacted due to failures (either top-down i.e. business function and identifying relevant software systems or reverse i.e. starting with software system and considering failure ramifications)
        - If existing components aren't contributing much value, then they shouldn't be copied into the new platform.
        - The notion that separating IT staff from business staff causes untold ills to such a profession like software development whose value is rooted in how much software is deeply entwined in the activity of the enterprise it supports.
        - When architects are disconnected from the understanding the flow of business value, it raises costs both in wasted technical effort and in loss of opportunities presented by changes in the environment. Software leaders need to put more attention into the interplay of business activities and software decision making, and ensure that this is part of the career development process for all the technical staff.

- Transport Level Communication (TLS)
    - Cryptography relies on ciphers to encrypt our data. A cipher suite is a set of cryptographic algorithms.
    - Cipher suites are used by Microsoft TLS/SSL Security provider to conduct secure communications over SSL or TLS
    - Older versions of Windows do not support strong cipher suites as demanded standards like PCI.
    - PCI Checklist, 
        -  Weak ciphers must not be used (e.g. less than 128 bits; no NULL ciphers suite, due to no encryption used; no Anonymous Diffie-Hellmann, due to not provides authentication).
	    - Weak protocols must be disabled (e.g. SSLv2 must be disabled, due to known weaknesses in protocol design).
	    - Renegotiation must be properly configured (e.g. Insecure Renegotiation must be disabled, due to MiTM attacks and Client-initiated Renegotiation must be disabled, due to Denial of Service vulnerability).
	    - No Export (EXP) level cipher suites, due to can be easily broken.
	    - X.509 certificates key length must be strong (e.g. if RSA or DSA is used the key must be at least 1024 bits).
	    - X.509 certificates must be signed only with secure hashing algoritms (e.g. not signed using MD5 hash, due to known collision attacks on this hash).
	    - Keys must be generated with proper entropy (e.g, Weak Key Generated with Debian).
        - PCI-DSS requires compliant parties to use “strong cryptography” without precisely defining key lengths and algorithms. Common interpretation, partially based on previous versions of the standard, is that at least 128 bit key cipher, no export strength algorithms and no SSLv2 should be used.

- [Investing][PersonalFinance]
    - Why is it essential not to buy below 200 DMA? 
        - First - Outperformance. Most managers beat the benchmarks in a bull market, only to give up all the gains in a bear market. Over the long term, the people who Outperformance the benchmarks across multiple cycles have this innate ability to cut their losses and beat the benchmarks relatively to the downside in a bear market. The 1960 Buffett Partnership letter to investors included the following observation “I have pointed out that any superior record which we might accomplish should not be expected to be evidenced by a relatively constant advantage in performance compared to the Average. Rather, if such an advantage is achieved, it will be through better-than-average performance in stable or declining markets and average, or perhaps poorer-than-average performance in rising markets”.  
        - Second - Institutions. Stock prices are a slave to sentiment, earnings, and liquidity. The liquidity comes from the institutions and not from retail. Most of these significant hedge funds and family offices do not touch anything below the 200 DMA.
        - Third - The biggest % rallies happen in a bear market. The so-called missing the best days snake oil propaganda sucks in naive investors and makes them buy the rally only to find their position down 20% further. They will be left with little or no capital when the new bull market arrives.
        - All of this doesn't matter, if you are indexing, in that case, just keep SIP'ing. Indices automatically cut the losers, and add to the winners.
    - Comebacks are rarely that lucrative. A double or a triple is normally a great result. You get your ten-baggers from young companies in their fast-growth phases, not mature companies in a midlife crisis.
    - Criteria for bargain hunting 
        - Debt free
        - Selling for less than cash i.e. price should be less than Cash available / no. of shares 
        - Earnings (price should be less than ten times earnings)

- Commodities 
    - are basic products, but not every basic product is a commodity.
    - all commodities come Physical out of the ground. Fundamentally, these commodities are are products created by natural forces
    - They are delivered globally, including by sea, usually in bulk.
    - Economies of scale favour bulk delivery. The cost of transportation makes location a significant pricing factor.
    - Commodities with similar physical characteristics are exchangeable, but these are not standard items. Exchanging them may have an effect on price and quality.
    - There is no premium for branded goods. Pricing is determined by product quality and availability.

- Source of stock lending, traditionally, is margin accounts at retail brokerages. The basic
deal is that if you open an account at a retail brokerage and buy stock with your own cash, your
broker generally won’t lend out your shares; if you open a margin account and buy stock partly
with money borrowed from your broker, your broker will probably try to lend out your shares to
short sellers, and keep the fees.

- The more you're forced to take ownership over your decisions, the faster you'll learn,
- Nothing inflation in is never economics is the same the second time after it happens than the first, because the first affects people’s attitudes in the second, and their attitudes always influence the activity itself. So the next crisis, the next crash, the next speculative mania is never exactly the same as the last. It merely rhymes.

- On Subsidies
    - Trader principle: those who make, distribute, and improve on the things people want and need reap their just rewards.

    - Subsidies exemplify cronyism, in which a government rewards companies according to proximity to power, not the value the company creates. Cronyism—an economy of “pull”—almost inevitably leads to stagnation. Subsidy seekers (moochers) benefit in the short term at the expense of everyone else. Subsidies are not only unjust, they also undermine the incentive structure that has led to progress and prosperity around the world.

    - Eat food that comes directly from animal or plant and not from packet. 
    - Eat the foods you want to eat that are, in general, closest to the way you might encounter them at their source. 
    - When we eat too many simple carbohydrates, we get a blood sugar spike, and then an insulin spike and a blood sugar crash, and the result is that we’re hungry again, even though we just ate. Many processed foods kick-start this reaction, making moderation and portion control goals seem insurmountable.

    - Every rule has its exceptions, and every principle has its limits
    - A dependency exists when a given piece of code cannot be understood and modifiedin isolation.
    - Tactical vs. Strategic programming - Strategic programming requires an investment mindset to improve the design of thesystem even if it's not the fastest path to finish your current project while Tactical focuses on finishing task within time. Best approach is to make lot of small investments on a continual basis. Effective teams know when to use tactical/strategic.

- Shift Left DevOps - Efforts of DevOps team to guarantee application security at the earliest stages in the development life cycle, as part of organization pattern known as DevSecOps. 
    - Measures for Automated Security Assessment as part of CI/CD Pipeline, 
        - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is used to scan source code for known weaknesses and insecure coding practices. In DevSecOps, this testing is typically integrated into developers’ development environments for immediate security risk feedback. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) analyzes software to detect known software components, such as open source and third-party libraries, and identify any associated vulnerabilities. SCA complements SAST by finding vulnerabilities not detectable by scanning source code.
        - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scans applications in runtime, prior to deployment into production environments. This enables an outside-in approach to testing applications for exploitable conditions that were not detectable in a static state.
        - Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) runs alongside applications in production to observe and analyze behavior and notify or block anomalous and unauthorized actions. While this may place additional infrastructural burden on production environments, it delivers a real-time look into potential application security risks.
        - Web Application Firewalls (WAF) monitor traffic at the application level and detect potential attacks and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities. WAFs can be configured to block certain potential attack vectors even without remediating the underlying software vulnerabilities.
        - Container image scanning tools can continuously and automatically scan container images within the CI/CD pipeline and in container registries, prior to deployment into production environments. This enables identification of vulnerabilities or unsafe components, and provides remediation or mitigation guidance directly to developers and DevOps teams.
        - Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solutions identify misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure that could leave potential risks and attack vectors unchecked. CSPM solutions can recommend or automatically apply security best practices based on an organization’s internal policies or third-party security standards.

- Food
    - Reheating food cooked with vegetable seed oil generate trans fats. These fats are not good for health.
    - A protein with a biological value of 100 contains all the amino acids in the right proportions for humans to use. Egg protein has a value of 100; gluten, the protein found in wheat, has a value of 64. If you eat eggs, you can use 100 percent of its protein. If you eat wheat, you can use only 64 percent of its protein. Plant proteins generally have lower biological values than animal proteins because humans are biologically much closer to animals than plants. Plant proteins serve vastly different purposes than animal proteins, such as contributing to photosynthesis, and they have vastly different physiology. However, the generally lower protein content and biological value of plants do not necessarily mean that plant foods are not good sources of protein.

    - The classic combination of rice and beans, for example, provides all the amino acids necessary for optimal health
    - A great way to get healthy sources of whole food plant protein is by eating organic nuts
    - The darker the honey, the better it is for your health.

- [Peter lynch on bonds,bank IPOs etc.][PersonalFinance]
    - Long term bonds (more than two to four years duration) are as volatile as stocks. 
    - When interest rates go up, bond prices go down
    - Bonds have no upside to reward if held till maturity. Less than maturity, you are exposing youself to potential losses. 
    - Plan for regular income over time, 
        - Let's say you've got $100,000 to invest for the long term, and you need an income of $7,000 per annum to make ends meet. Youc an get it by purchasing a 30-year bond paying 7 percent. But instead, you take Lynch's advice, shun the bonds, and build a portfolio of stocks that pays you a 3 percent dividend. In the first year you get $3,000 in dividends. Since you need $7,000to live on, you're $4,000 short on the income side, but that can be solved. You sell $4,000 worth of stock. It may sound crazy to be selling shares that you bought 12 months earlier, but bear with me. Let's assume the prices have gone up 8 percent, which is the historical norm for stocks. (Overtime, stocks return 8 percent on the price gains and 3 percent on the dividends, for a total return of 11 percent.) Between the dividends and the price gains, your portfolio would be worth$111,000 after the first year if you left it alone. But you don't. You take out the $3,000 in dividends and you sell the $4,000chunk of stock. After putting this $7,000 in your pocket, you begin year two with $104,000 in the account. You can see from the table on the next page what happens next. The companies in which you've invested raise their dividends as usual, so in the second year, the portfolio gives you an income of $3,120. At the end of year two, you have to sell only $3,880worth of stock to reach your $7,000 goal. Every year thereafter, as dividends are raised and stock prices go up, you're selling less and less stock to cover your expenses. In year 16, you receive$7,000 out of the dividends alone, and from this point forward, you never have to sell a single share to get the customary payout. In fact, your payout goes up. These numbers are theoretical, but they're based on the average returns from stocks and dividends over this entire century. Assuming these same results hold for the future, after 20 years, your original $100,000 will have grown into $349,140. You'll be more than three times richer than when you started, on top of the$146,820 worth of dividends you've spent along the way. By taking the bond route, you would have received $140,000 in interest and gotten your $100,000 back.

## 2022-may-23 Mon

- Quotes
    - Hanlon's Razor: The number of genuinely evil people in the world is minuscule compared to the number of idiots, so never blame on malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity. 
    - Bonhoeffer's Theory of Stupidity: Evil can be guarded against. Stupidity cannot. And the world's few evil people have little power without the help of the world's many stupid people. As a result, stupidity is a far greater threat than evil.
    - Mean World Syndrome: The news exists to get your attention, so it tends to shock. As such, it doesn't reflect reality but precisely that which is uncharacteristic of reality. But since it's all we see, we begin to think the world is crazier than it actually is.
    - Sealioning: When someone pesters an online opponent with endless "innocent" questions to clarify their position. The sealion has no interest in the answers, but by questioning can expend minimal effort while exhausting the opponent until they slip or flip, "losing" the debate.
    - Two-Step Flow Theory: Most people's opinions are copied from their favorite influencers, who in turn copy the opinions of their favored mass media. As such, politics is largely a battle between two armies of puppets being ventriloquized by a handful of actual thinkers.
    - Sayre's Law: The lower the stakes, the more vicious the politics. In tense nuclear talks, people act civilized. In Twitter culture wars, people act like Armageddon has come, raging like maniacs, calling for total war, safe in the knowledge none of it matters.
    - Blind Men & An Elephant: People assume their experiences are a representative sample of the universe, and thus base their assumptions about reality on a few meager impressions. They shrink the world to fit their minds and think they've expanded their minds to grasp the world.
    - The Lesser Minds Problem: We dismiss those we disagree with as stupid, insane or evil because it saves us from having to deal with the complex truth: that people see things differently from us largely because the labyrinth of experience has led them to different conclusions.
    - Rally 'Round The Flag Syndrome: During times of crisis, approval ratings of political leaders go up as people unify against the threat. This incentivizes unpopular leaders to exaggerate, fabricate, or even initiate crises (e.g. by starting wars).
    - Fact-check is shitty thing to do
    - Principle of Least Effort: Human behavior tends to favor the path that requires least effort. People will accept the first idea that comes to mind, get their info from the first relevant search result, etc. This makes them easy to predict and vulnerable to error.
    - Sturgeon's Law: 90% of everything is crap. Doesn't matter if you're talking about books, science papers, tweets, YouTube videos. Due to the Principle of Least Effort, the vast majority of works produced in any medium are low effort garbage, so consume with extreme prejudice.
    - The Imp Of The Perverse: When you forbid someone from something, it makes them want it even more. A big reason why censorship is often ineffective; banning information only increases its appeal, leading to a Streisand Effect in which the info becomes shared even more widely.
    - Iron Law Of Oligarchy: All organizations of people, no matter how democratic & egalitarian, will eventually be controlled by a dominant few, since if everyone has power then no one has power, and if someone has power, they'll use it to get more power.
    - Noble Cause Corruption:The greatest evils come not from people seeking to do bad, but people seeking to do good and believing the ends justify the means. Ironically, few things legitimize the immoral treatment of others more than the belief that you're more moral than them.
    - Agenda-Setting Theory: What's important doesn't become the news, the news becomes what's important. The public conversation is based on whatever's reported by the press, giving the impression that this news matters most, when really it's just what was chosen by a few editors.
    - Firehosing: With so many competing narratives in the digital age, disinformation agents can't convince you of any single narrative, so instead they overwhelm you with many contradictory narratives until you start to doubt everything and become confused, demoralized & passive.
    - Intellectual Obesity: We evolved to seek out sugar as it was a scarce source of energy. But when we learned to mass-produce it, our love for it became a liability. The same is true of data. Our curiosity, which once focused us, now distracts us, bloating our minds with junk.
    - 10:10:10 Strategy: If you're fighting an addiction and tempted to have a cigarette/chocolate muffin/Twitter scroll, consider how indulging now will make you feel in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years. Escape the lure of immediate gratification by stepping out of the present.
    - Beautiful Mess Effect: We tend to view our mistakes & vulnerabilities with shame because we think they make us look unappealing. But research suggests our mistakes & vulnerabilities actually make us more relatable and endearing to other people. So don't be afraid to be human.
    - Backwards Law: The more you pursue happiness, the less likely you are to obtain it, because chasing it will only remind you how much you don't have it. Ironically, the best way to find happiness is to stop worrying about it.
    - Reversion to the mean is a powerful force. In economics as well as politics, extremes
    cannot survive for long. People tend toward average, and competitive forces in business
    lead to mean reversion.


- [Value Averaging][PersonalFinance]
    - In value averaging, you set a target amount by which you want your account to grow each period. Say you want to end each month with $1,000 more than you started with. In periods when stocks fall, you have to add enough to your holdings to hit the target you’ve set. If, for instance, the value of your portfolio falls $250, you would need to buy $1,250 in stocks to finish the month with $1,000 more than you had at the beginning. If your portfolio’s value drops $500, then you’d add $1,500, and so on. In a rising market, you’d buy less than $1,000—and even sell some, if stock prices go through the roof.
    - Most investing is learning to accept being wrong, not holding a single point of view, and working to discover what is not known. It is forcing yourself to be the ultimate scientist. 

    - “Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.”

    - The difference between good and great results is often found in consistently doing the boring things you know you should do exactly when you feel like doing them the least.

- About Solid state drives (SSD)
    - A solid-state drives (SSD) is a flash-memory based data storage device. Bits are stored into cells, which exist in three types: 1 bit per cell (single level cell, SLC), 2 bits per cell (multiple level cell, MLC), 3 bits per cell (triple-level cell, TLC).
    - Each cell has a maximum number of P/E cycles (Program/Erase), after which the cell is considered defective. This means that NAND-flash memory wears off and has a limited lifespan.
    - The two main host interfaces offered by manufacturers are SATA 3.0 (550 MB/s) and PCI Express 3.0 (1 GB/s per lane, using multiple lanes). Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is also available for enterprise SSDs. In their latest versions, PCI Express and SAS are faster than SATA, but they are also more expensive.

- About France
    - The African and Eurasian tectonic plates push each other, forming the southern European mountains.
    - These create a bad terrain for agriculture in Southern Europe (hence its relative poverty), but an extremely high density of navigable waterways in Northern Europe.
    - These rivers have facilitated the emergence of plenty of independent cultures in Europe.
    - Many of them have remained independent, except in France, where all these waterways connect to each other. That has created a massive interconnected economy that very quickly grew its population and wealth.
    - Cities sprung up at every confluence of every river. Since the land is so fertile, and so many of these rivers were navigable, the population and wealth grew over time, especially in the northern half of France. Within all of that, Paris was naturally the best positioned city, at the confluence of all these rivers, within the most fertile region in the country, and close enough to its trade partners and enemies.
    - If the Rhône had flowed northwards, and the mountains between the Alps, the Massif Central, and the Pyrenees had touched each other, there wouldn’t have been passes between the amazingly rich northern part of France and the Mediterranean coast. That would have made the unity of the north and south nearly impossible, France would be at least two countries, and what is today northern France would have never been as powerful as it has been.
    - The flat land in the north of the continent is called the Northern European Plain, and is some of the most fertile land on earth. France was gifted with a big chunk of it, making it remarkably fertile.
    - But unlike most other northern European countries, France is safely protected by seas and mountains.
    - Its only opening is through the northeast, what is today Belgium, and exposes France to Germany, a more powerful country because of its higher population that comes from its higher population density. This is why France will always obsess about Germany, and needs it as a tight ally in the EU to secure its existence.
    - That means that the seas were never the biggest priority for France, which is why it never invested much in its colonies, why most of them lost money, and why France is the biggest maritime country in the world: it kept islands here and there that were poor enough that nobody wanted to fight for them.
    - France's population has been in decline. This smaller population is the reason why France is weaker economically than Germany—it’s not productivity: France’s productivity per worker is higher than Germany’s .
    - Germany, meanwhile, can be threatened on all sides, so it benefits from good relationships with its regional neighbors—for example, with Russia. Giving up Russia is much riskier for Germany than France, and increases its exposure to France.

- when there are vast numbers of people to coordinate, and they have access to most of the information about the problem they must solve, decision-making should not be centralized.

- Daniel Kahneman's 2 Systems of thinking, 
    - System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. 
    - The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person—including things you have not observed—is known as the halo effect.
    - System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration. It is activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that system 1 maintains. 
    - Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention. 
    - System 2 is activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains.
    - acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and
    costs
    - One of the main functions of System 2 is to monitor and control thoughts and actions “suggested” by System 1, allowing some to be expressed directly in behavior and suppressing or modifying others. 
    -  System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy. 
    - Principle of Skill training - rewards for improved performance works better than punishment of mistakes.
    - Extreme predictions and a willingness to predict rare events from weak evidence are both
    manifestations of System 1
    - A general limitation of the human mind is its imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of
    knowledge, or beliefs that have changed. Once you adopt a new view of the world (or of
    any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to
    believe before your mind changed.

- Daniel Kahneman's Thinking fast and slow,
    -  the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. 
    - A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because
    familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.
    - Biological fact: an organism should react cautiously to a novel stimulus, with
    withdrawal and fear.
    - When you have doubts about the quality of the evidence: let your judgments of
    probability stay close to the base rate.
    -You should not let yourself believe whatever comes to your mind. To be useful, your
    beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.
    - Base rates matter, even in the presence of evidence about the case at hand.
    - extreme groups regress to the mean over time
    - The magic of error reduction works well only when the observations are independent and their errors uncorrelated.To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always try to make these sources independent of each other.
    - The financial benefits of self-employment are mediocre: given the same qualifications, people achieve higher average returns by selling their skills to employers than by setting out on their own. The evidence suggests that optimism is widespread, stubborn, and costly.
    - Rehearse the mantra that will get you significantly closer to economic rationality: you win a few, you lose a few. The main purpose of the mantra is to control your emotional response when you do lose.
    - If you are serious about hiring the best possible person for the job, this is what you should do. First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, and so on). Don’t overdo it - six dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1–5 scale. Collect the information on one trait at a time, scoring each before you move on to the next one. Do not skip around. To evaluate each candidate, add up the six scores.
    - If you were allowed one wish for your child, seriously consider wishing him or her optimism. Optimists are normally cheerful and happy, and therefore popular; they are resilient in adapting to failures and hardships, their chances of clinical depression are reduced, their immune system is stronger, they take better care of their health, they feel healthier than others and are in fact likely to live longer. A study of `
    people who exaggerate their expected life span beyond actuarial predictions showed that they work longer hours, are more optimistic about their future
    - Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones.
    - Rational investors trade only if the expected gains exceed transactions costs
    - Overconfident investors overestimate the precision of their information and thereby the expected gains of trading.
    - Individuals and mutual funds that trade most earn the lowest returns.
    - The evidence from more than fifty years of research is conclusive: for a large majority of fund managers, the selection of stocks is more like rolling dice than like playing poker. Typically at least two out of every three mutual funds underperform the overall market in any given year. 
    - Financial experts (and media) are in the business of creating illusion of valid prediction. 
    - Person who acquires more knowledge develops an enhanced illusion of her skill and becomes unrealistically overconfident

- Travel 
        - Odissha,
        - If you are a bird watchers, mangaljodi near chilka is a must. But not many accommodation options though
        - Am not sure why you are covering Gopalpur in that limited time. Chilka, Puri and Bhubaneswar is the perfect triangle 
                - Gopalpur I heard has better beaches. And if you are going from Bhubaneswar to Chilika, then Gopalpur is not far away. That said, Puri does make for a decent substitute for Gopalpur in case you want to see the Jagannath Temple and/or Konark Temple. Their are Architectural marvels. Just make sure that you do not land in these temples on a weekend or on a religiously significant day. The whole experience for me at any of these temples has been dependent on whether there was sparse crowd, or a lot of it.
                - Chilika dhaba .. at chilika lake. Absolute must do for sea food lovers. Bhubaneswar you can do Raja Rani temple, lingaraj. Gopalpur I've heard good things about the beach but the sea is very very rough and unpredictable these days even minus monsoon
            - Given limited time in Bhubaneswar, you would probably choose to cover Konark Temple, Chausath yogini temple in Hirapur is a notable diversion imo on way back, there are only a handful such temples in india.. (edited) 
            - I just saw that you are staying there for 3 days. So, I would recommend that you cancel Gopalpur and go to Puri itself.
            - In Bhubaneswar itself there's Udaygiri, Khandgiri caves and dhauli inscriptions if you are a history buff, lingaraja temple .. note that if you stay in Puri it'll be easier to cover more of this but honestly given limited time..do konark, Chausath yogini and Ashoka dhauli inscriptions on way back
            - In Puri the best properties are Hans Coco Palm and Mayfair. Hans has a better beach access. Puri is a laid back place with nothing to do, the Jagannath temple is closed this time of year because the Lords have a fever else I would have recommended a temple meal which is delicious. I would definitely recommend going to Raghurajpur there which is on outskirts. It's a craft village and you will get remarkable paintings and handicrafts direct from artisans. My other favourite hidden place about Puri is its government bhang shop. If you choose Puri, you can lounge a day there and cover Konark in afternoon. That'll give little more time for Bhubaneswar the next day. Btw In monsoons the sea is rough and going for a dip either in Gopalpur or Puri may not be that much fun (edited) 
            - Gopalpur is meh except the Mayfair resort there.I would skip it.
            - Puri is overhyped (unless visiting temple is something you want to do). For most of our weekends in college, we prefered driving to Konark instead ,using the new BBSR-Puri highway and then Marine drive. Lotus resort in Konark is at par with Mayfair at Puri. Beaches are better. Konark sun temple is there if temple is something you’d like to visit.
            - There's no good touristy thing to do in BBSR. Udaygiri and Khandagiri are absolutely avoidable.
            I feel the same way about BBSR except an hour at Lingaraj temple complex. I don't like those Udaygiri/ Khandgiri.
            - Eat/drink recommendations:
                -Mayfair lagoon, Bbsr
                -Ram Mandir alley for all the Food trucks, Bbsr
                -NEVER eat those white round sweet things they call Rasgulla. You’ll lose faith in Rosogolla if you try them. Avoid
                -Dalma & Pakhal are low key good but i doubt any tourist will eat them when they are there. It was more of a local thingy when I was living there -kheera=milk & not kheer, pilla= child and not “kutte ka baccha”. So dont get them 
                - Sweets, I should add, uniquely there is chhena poda (sort of like a sweet chenna bread) and khaja. I have not seen the 2 of any comparable quality outside Odisha. 
                -also, Chena poda. The best Chena poda you can get is at the sweet shop in Mayfair Lagoon, Bbsr
                - If you do Puri, then do go to Ananda bazaar (iirc) in the temple and eat the bhog. Most satisfying meal I've ever had. You can also try the different gaujjas that the suars (the sweetshop owners) sell. Super stuff. But this is also Rath Yatra season. So take care!
                -  snana purnima happened a few days back. The lords are kept out of sight till Rath Yatra as they catch a fever after the bath (which is 15 days).. There'll be no food. Lingaraja will be open, in general odisha temple food is :ok_hand: (edited)
