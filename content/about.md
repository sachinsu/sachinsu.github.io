I am a software architect with more than 2 decades of experience, currently working at [@worldlineglobal](https://twitter.com/WorldlineGlobal). This is my personal site where i share helpful content (gathered or authored) on Technology (and other topics). 

I appreciate any [ideas/suggestions you have](https://github.com/sachinsu/sachinsu.github.io/issues/new) on how I can improve this site.
