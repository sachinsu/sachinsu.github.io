The requirement is as simple as consuming REST API from a Application over TLS.
Problem Statement The REST API, to be consumed, is standard API interface which requires access over TLS. The client in this case is Windows 2016 server.
During Development, Windows 10 is used to develop and test the code.</description>

This means that upgrade must be done keeping in mind,</description>
