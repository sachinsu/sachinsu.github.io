      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a list of all the components, libraries, and modules that make
up a software, providing transparency into its composition. It describes various packages and dependencies that go into creating a software artifact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software products are composed of many different components, some of which might come from
third party sources. These third-party components and dependencies can have vulnerabilities, which
attackers can exploit, leading to security incident or breaches. Key threats include attackers inserting
malicious code, vulnerabilities in outdated components, and breaches by compromised suppliers. These issues can lead to data breaches, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. SBOM can help improve software security and protect against potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
