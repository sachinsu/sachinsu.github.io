      <description>Background I started this blog, https://sachinsu.github.io few months back .
In this relatively short period of time, Blog has sizeable number of useful links across various categories in addition to the detailed blog post like this one.
As an ongoing activity, I think that it is necessary to verify links mentioned on this blog.
So how can it be done ? obviously one way is to do it manually by visiting each link and updating/removing those that are no longer available.</description>
