Good software architecture is crucial for a business to reach its goals. It provides a structured way to build software that is easy to maintain, reliable, and performs well.
Key drivers of software architecture
Several factors influence a software&rsquo;s architecture:

Business requirements: What the software needs to do.
Quality attributes: How well the software performs, such as its speed, scalability, and availability.
Agility: How quickly the development team can adapt to changes.
Constraints: The limitations of the deployment environment, such as the hardware or operating system.
Principles: Established practices, like automated testing and deployment, that guide the development process.

Constraints: The limitations of the deployment environment, such as the hardware or operating system. Principles: Established practices, like automated testing and deployment, that guide the development process. Different Ways to Structure Software There are two main ways to build software applications:\nMonolith: This is the traditional way, like building a single, giant house. All the parts of the application—the user interface, the business rules, and the database—are all bundled together in one big piece. This can be simpler to start with, but it has some drawbacks:\nRigid: A change in one part of the application can affect all the other parts. Slow to update: Even a small change requires you to re-deploy the entire application, which can be time-consuming. Microservices : This is a more modern approach, like building a city of small, specialized shops. Instead of one big application, you create many small, independent services. Each service does one specific job and can be updated and deployed on its own.\nFlexible: You can update and deploy parts of the application without affecting the rest. This makes it easier to respond to changes quickly. Complex: This approach is more complicated to manage and is best suited for large, complex projects. You have to deal with challenges like ensuring data is consistent across all the services. At a high level, Monolith approach has shown need for adaptation when it comes of agility expected from Software, while MicroServices provides agility. However, Micro services often require change in Organization’s approach and found to be appropriate for use cases where benefits outweigh related concerns like Eventual consistency, Operational Complexity and Distributed nature. Also refer to Remote calls/Fallacies of Distributed computing.\nGiven this, are their any tailored approaches that find middle ground? Let’s look at few of them ,\nModular Monolith - Approach that tries to have golden mean between Monolith and Microservices by structuring the application into independent modules or components with well-defined boundaries with future possibilities of carving out microservices. Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA)- Architecture is built around distinct requests, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back-end. Clean Architecture - Paradigm originally proposed by Robert Martin that isolates interfaces (user interfaces, databases, external systems, devices) from business logic. This article aims to provide general context and aid in decision making about the above architecture styles. Please note Limitations of General Advice.\nUnderstanding Each style: Modular Monolith Core Idea: is a way of organizing a software application into set of well defined, independent, extractable Modules.Modules have ‌specific functionality, which can be independently developed and tested, while the entire application is deployed as a single unit.\nKey Characteristics: Encapsulation, clear boundaries between modules, high cohesion within modules, low coupling between modules.\nBenefits: Easier to start, single deployment, can evolve towards microservices if needed, good for smaller to medium teams. Suitable to manage when significant domain-specific changes are expected.\nPotential Drawbacks/Concerns: Can become a “big ball of mud” if modularity isn’t strictly enforced, deployment unit size. These issues may be addressed using Fitness functions (e.g. Cyclomatic complexity, coupling) and static code analysis etc. Carries on with some monolith bottlenecks like fault tolerance, scalability, elasticity etc.\nModular Monolith Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) Core Idea: This is in a way evolution of Modular Monolith where focus is on axes of expected change and modelling features end-to-end for it. For every individual request(s), all the code is co-located across layers. Organizing code around business capabilities or “verticals” (e.g., user management, order processing) rather than technical layers (UI, Business Logic, Data Access). A Module may have one or more features. Each feature is self-contained and can be developed/tested independently. Module boundaries are explicit. Aim is to Minimize coupling between slices and maximize within slice.\nKey Characteristics: Code organized by feature/capability, strong encapsulation within slices, minimal dependencies between slices, often involves defining clear boundaries.\nBenefits: High cohesion within slices, improved team autonomy, easier to understand and modify specific features, good for evolving complexity.\nPotential Drawbacks: Can lead to duplication if not managed carefully (e.g., common domain logic), requires a discipline of keeping slices truly independent.\nVertical Slice Architecture Vertical Slice Architecture Clean Architecture (or similar layered/hexagonal approaches): Core Idea: opinionated way to structure code and to separate the concerns of the application into layers. Core aim is to separate the business logic from infrastructure (i.e. data Access, external integrations etc.) and presentation layers. Originally popularized by Robert C Martin. Crux is to have business logic isolated from less stable external elements.\nKey Characteristics:\nDomain as the core, use of interfaces for external interactions. Aim is to achieve maintainability, testability, and extendability Ability to change infrastructure and presentation without affecting core business logic Ideal for complex, medium to large scale applications where maintainability and scalability are key objectives. Benefits: High testability, framework independence, maintainability, clear separation of concerns, easier to swap out external components.\nPotential Drawbacks: Can be perceived as overly complex for simple projects. Strict adhering to layering and use of interfaces often lead to lot of boilerplate code. Simple Applications may find it as overhead to implement.\nClean Architecture Comparative Analysis: Aspect Modular Monolith Vertical Slice Architecture Clean Architecture Application Size Suitable for small to medium Sized Applications. Easy to get started and is cost effective. Agnostic of Application size. But keep watch for refactoring opty. Larger initial codebase due to abstractions but clean separation helps irrespective of size Organization Modular approach per Domain functionalities By feature or use case, with each slice containing all relevant layers. by layers i.e. Presentation, Domain and Infrastructure Maintainability, Testability Individual slices/use cases can be tested Easier to maintain and test, as changes are localized to a single feature slice. Improved testability Flexibility Improved due to modularity but may require complete deployment High. Different features can use different technical implementations. High due to isolation of layers Scalability Useful when future scalability requirements are uncertain. Slices can be deployed independently Can be achieved by means of isolation of state management and ability to switch implementations Testability better than trad.Monolith High Each layer can be tested independently, Synergies and Overlaps: As one says there is no “one size fits all”, similarly there is no reason to constrain self to use a specific architectural style for Application and neither of the above styles are mutually exclusive. A Modular Monolith is where modules are structured but can use Vertical slice Architecture principles. A VSA based implementation can adopt clean Architecture principles with clean separation between domain logic and adapters (UI, Data stores, external integrations etc.) While VSA focuses on what to organize by, Clean Architecture focuses on how to organize within those boundaries.\nConclusion: The Architecture styles evolve as they are tested against real-time requirements in terms of flexibility, maintainability, scalability and so on. There is no one architecture style that fits many situation but each of the style provides path way to think and analyze fitment for the actual use case. As the First Law of Software Architecture states that everything in software is a trade-off, key is to evaluate these styles against requirements and arrive at acceptable tradeoffs and decide based on it.\nUseful References Modular Monolith 1 Modular Monolith 2 Modular Monolith 3 Vertical Slice Architecture 1 Clean Architecture from Robert Martin Clean Architecture 1 Clean Architecture 2 Clean Architecture 3 Cognitive load is all that matters Happy Coding !!\n","wordCount":"1290","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://sachinsu.github.io/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2025-09-15T01:00:00+05:30","dateModified":"2025-09-15T01:00:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sachin Sunkle"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/comparearchitecturestyles/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Learnings in IT","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://sachinsu.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://sachinsu.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Learnings in IT (Alt + H)">Learnings in IT</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
