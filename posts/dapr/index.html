Every developer is a developer or consumer of distributed systems, as mentioned by Brendan Burns here.
Distributed applications are software systems that consist of multiple components or modules running on different infrastructure within a network. These components work together to achieve a common goal or provide a service, communicating and coordinating their actions across the network.
Most organizations build distributed applications for two main reasons. First, they have multiple development teams that need to work independently while contributing to a larger system. Second, they require a solution where components built using different programming languages can interact with each other.">

These components work together to achieve a common goal or provide a service, communicating and coordinating their actions across the network.\nMost organizations build distributed applications for two main reasons. First, they have multiple development teams that need to work independently while contributing to a larger system. Second, they require a solution where components built using different programming languages can interact with each other.\nDeveloping distributed applications is challenging because numerous components need to work cohesively. Developers must consider resiliency, observability, security, and scalability across multiple services and runtimes. Furthermore, distributed applications typically don’t operate in isolation; they interact with message brokers, data stores, and external services. Integrating with these resources requires knowledge of specific APIs and SDKs which increases the complexity to build such systems.\nTo summarize,\nDevelopment - They are harder to develop and operate. Programming models are often optimized for in-process communication in terms of development and testing. However, Services, in a distributed application, involve remote/out of process calls (e.g. https/gRPC). This makes it difficult to program, debug/test and operate them. Eventual Consistency - Microservices introduce eventual consistency because of their laudable insistence on decentralized data management. One is most likely to face issue of “Dual writes” (The dual-write problem occurs when two external systems must be updated in an atomic fashion) in distributed application. Operability - Managing multiple independent services have its pros but induce complexity when it comes to frequent deployments and monitoring. As aptly put by Martin fowler here, “Low bar for skill is higher in a microservice environment”. Deployment - Cloud brings in another dimension where companies want to leverage them for their benefits but want to be agnostic or avoid lock-in to a particular vendor. Fallacies of Distributed Computing articulates all these relevant aspects.\nThis post details how Dapr helps with Distributed Applications Development as well as Agentic workloads.\nDapr Dapr, short for Distributed Application Runtime, is a CNCF graduated open source project.\nSince it’s inception in 2019, it has evolved and is battle tested. True to the moto of CNCF, It provides vendor-neutral approach that decouples the infrastructure from application code so developers can focus on business logic instead of infra. plumbing.\nIt uses a sidecar pattern that runs as a separate process alongside the application. It provides multiple building blocks, from service invocation and messaging, jobs, workflow to distributed lock, all of which are common patterns in distributed communication. It makes it seamless to design, develop and run distributed applications from local environment to remote (be it private data center or cloud).\nKey benefits of Dapr are,\nNo more boilerplate: Store state through the Dapr API and let the platform team pick Redis, Cosmos DB, DynamoDB, etc. Doing pub/sub messaging? Swap RabbitMQ for Kafka via config, not code. Polyglot by design: Java, .NET, Python, Go, JavaScript; mix and match safely across teams. Built-in Resilience and security : mTLS, retries, circuit breakers, and consistent observability patterns are part of the runtime “golden path.” Designed for Operations - Supports integration with observability tools to make it easier to run the system. sidecars, runtime, components, and configuration can all be managed and deployed easily and securely to match your organization’s needs. Below is summary of some of the interesting building blocks. For complete list, refer here.\nService invocation Helps abstract service discovery and perform secure calls between services.\nTypical use cases, - Abstract details (location etc.) needed for invoking services thus making them deployable on various target platforms\nWorkflows Code-first approach for authoring workflow steps. Diagrid offers workflow code generator which prompts for workflow modelled as diagram (UML, BPMN etc.) and generates boilerplate code that uses Dapr SDK. Check it out here.\nTypical use cases,\nEvent-driven data pipelines and ETL jobs Payment and transaction processing with compensations Customer onboarding and document verification flows Automated deployment or model training pipelines IoT device provisioning and firmware rollout sequences Pub/sub Provides a platform-agnostic API to send and receive messages for a service. Avoids hard dependency on specific Messaging system.\nState Management Provides HTTP API to persist and retrieve key-value pairs from State while having pluggable state store. supports automatic client encryption of application state with support for key rotations. As part of state management, it enables developers to use the outbox pattern for achieving a single transaction across a transactional state store and any message broker. Refer here for more details.\nJobs jobs API is an orchestrator for scheduling these future jobs, either at a specific time or for a specific interval.\nTypical use cases,\nBatch processing - Long running processing of large number of transactions. reports generation etc. Demo For the purpose of the Demo, Lets have hypothetical use case for a Tenant Management System with below services,\nTenant Service - Responsible for managing lifecycle of Tenant starting with onboarding. It receives request for new tenant, validates it and invokes notification to intimate tenant itself via e-mail.\nNotification Service - This services exposes interface to receive requests from notification and then pushes it to pub/sub queue for processing by specific services meant for sending e-mail, SMS and so on.\nBelow is depiction of the flow,\nSetup Dapr by following instructions here\nTenant service is developed using Spring Boot while Notification Service uses .NET Core.\nBelow snapshot shows Controller function that calls notification service, Below snapshot shows Notification service using Dapr .NET SDK to push message, Demo uses below building blocks are used for the demo,\nService invocation Pub/sub Dapr Multi-app run is very handy for local development lifecycle and same is used for this. Below is dapr configuration used,\nResiliency configuration looks like below,\nAll is good but what is trade-off? Lets do some load testing to assess impact of sidecar pattern of dapr vis-a-vis direct invocation. We will use k6 to perform load testing. Note that, below test was conducted on my development laptop with no specific optimizations and modalities.\nLoad testing criteria is setup as below,\nBelow are the results,\nWith dapr\nHTTP http_req_duration…………..: avg=6.51ms min=510µs med=2.11ms max=1.83s p(90)=3.7ms p(95)=4.89ms { expected_response:true }…: avg=6.52ms min=510µs med=2.11ms max=1.83s p(90)=3.7ms p(95)=4.89ms Without dapr\nHTTP http_req_duration…………..: avg=9.39ms min=308.09µs med=3.9ms max=2.94s p(90)=8.63ms p(95)=16.3ms { expected_response:true }…: avg=9.4ms min=308.09µs med=3.9ms max=2.94s p(90)=8.63ms p(95)=16.31ms It seems that dapr results in better throughput than direct. This will have to dealt in detail on why this happens as generally direct communication will not have any overhead associated with sidecar. Let me know your thoughts in comments.\nGen AI Dapr is keeping pace with tech. landscape changes and When it comes to Generative AI use cases and its implementation, it has a building block named Dapr Agents for it. In this, all the building blocks are extended to serve agentic Workload aimed at data crunching, inferencing with Large Language Models (LLM) and operate them at scale.\nIt excels at below aspects compared to other Agentic frameworks, - Guardrails - Obfuscation of Sensitive data while interacting with LLMs - Authentication over MCP (Built-in identity using SPIFEE) - mTLS for securing communication between Agents. - Durable workflows - Event driven ingestion\nSummary Dapr helps with\nStandardized vendor-neutral approach, eliminating concerns about lock-in, intellectual property risks, or proprietary restrictions. Organizations gain full flexibility and control over their Distributed/microservices based applications. Dapr works both for greenfield projects (built from scratch) and brownfield applications (existing applications being modernized or migrated). A common scenario is migrating a monolithic or traditional service-based app to Kubernetes or another cloud-native infrastructure: Dapr can be introduced to handle inter-service communication, messaging, state, secrets — without rewriting the whole application. Happy Coding !!\n",

<p>Every developer is a developer or consumer of distributed systems, as mentioned by Brendan Burns <a href=https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-CNTNT-eBook-DesigningDistributedSystems.pdf
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>here</a>.</p>
<p>Distributed applications are software systems that consist of multiple components or modules running on different infrastructure within a network. These components work together to achieve a common goal or provide a service, communicating and coordinating their actions across the network.</p>
<p>Most organizations build distributed applications for two main reasons. First, they have multiple development teams that need to work independently while contributing to a larger system. Second, they require a solution where components built using different programming languages can interact with each other.</p>
<p>Developing distributed applications is challenging because numerous components need to work cohesively. Developers must consider resiliency, observability, security, and scalability across multiple services and runtimes. Furthermore, distributed applications typically don’t operate in isolation; they interact with message brokers, data stores, and external services. Integrating with these resources requires knowledge of specific APIs and SDKs which increases the complexity to build such systems.</p>
<p>To summarize,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development</strong> - They are harder to develop and operate. Programming models are often optimized for in-process communication in terms of development and testing. However, Services, in a distributed application, involve remote/out of process calls (e.g. https/gRPC). This makes it difficult to program, debug/test and operate them.</li>
<li><strong>Eventual Consistency</strong> - Microservices introduce eventual consistency  because of their laudable insistence on decentralized data management. One is most likely to face issue of &ldquo;Dual writes&rdquo; (The dual-write problem occurs when two external systems must be updated in an atomic fashion) in distributed application.</li>
<li><strong>Operability</strong> - Managing multiple independent services have its pros but induce complexity when it comes to frequent deployments and monitoring. As aptly put by Martin fowler <a href=https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html#distribution
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>here</a>, &ldquo;Low bar for skill is higher in a microservice environment&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong> - Cloud brings in another dimension where companies want to leverage them for their benefits but want to be agnostic or avoid lock-in to a particular vendor.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>Fallacies of Distributed Computing</a> articulates all these relevant aspects.</p>
<p>This post details how <a href=https://dapr.io
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>Dapr</a> helps with Distributed Applications Development as well as Agentic workloads.</p>
<h2 id="dapr">Dapr<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dapr">#</a></h2>
<p><a href=https://dapr.io
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>Dapr</a>, short for Distributed Application Runtime, is a <a href=https://www.cncf.io/projects/dapr/
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>CNCF graduated open source project</a>.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s inception in 2019, it has evolved and is battle tested. True to the moto of CNCF,  It provides vendor-neutral approach that decouples the infrastructure from application code so developers can focus on business logic instead of infra. plumbing.</p>
<p>It uses a sidecar pattern that runs as a separate process alongside the application. It provides multiple building blocks, from service invocation and messaging, jobs, workflow to distributed lock, all of which are common patterns in distributed communication. It makes it seamless to design, develop and run distributed applications from local environment to remote (be it private data center or cloud).</p>
<p>Key benefits of Dapr are,</p>
<ul>
<li><em>No more boilerplate</em>: Store state through the Dapr API and let the platform team pick Redis, Cosmos DB, DynamoDB, etc. Doing pub/sub messaging? Swap RabbitMQ for Kafka via config, not code.</li>
<li><em>Polyglot by design</em>: Java, .NET, Python, Go, JavaScript; mix and match safely across teams.</li>
<li><em>Built-in Resilience and security</em> : mTLS, retries, circuit breakers, and consistent observability patterns are part of the runtime “golden path.”</li>
<li>Designed for <a href=https://docs.dapr.io/operations/
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>Operations</a> - Supports integration with observability tools to make it easier to <em>run</em> the system.</li>
<li>sidecars, runtime, components, and configuration can all be managed and deployed easily and securely to match your organization’s needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is summary of some of the interesting  building blocks.  For complete list, refer <a href=https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/building-blocks-concept/
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>here</a>.</p>
<pre><code><figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="/images/dapr/modular_landscape.png"/> 
    </figure>

</code></pre>
<h3 id="service-invocation">Service invocation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#service-invocation">#</a></h3>
<p>Helps abstract service discovery and perform secure calls between services.</p>
<p>Typical use cases,
- Abstract details (location etc.) needed for invoking services thus making them deployable on various target platforms</p>
<h3 id="workflows">Workflows<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#workflows">#</a></h3>
<p>Code-first approach for authoring workflow steps. Diagrid offers workflow code generator which prompts for workflow modelled as diagram (UML, BPMN etc.) and generates boilerplate code that uses Dapr SDK. Check it out <a href=https://workflows.diagrid.io/
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>here</a>.</p>
<p>Typical use cases,</p>
<ul>
<li>Event-driven data pipelines and ETL jobs</li>
<li>Payment and transaction processing with compensations</li>
<li>Customer onboarding and document verification flows</li>
<li>Automated deployment or model training pipelines</li>
<li>IoT device provisioning and firmware rollout sequences</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pubsub">Pub/sub<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pubsub">#</a></h3>
<p>Provides a platform-agnostic API to send and receive messages for a service. Avoids hard dependency on specific Messaging system.</p>
<h3 id="state-management">State Management<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#state-management">#</a></h3>
<p>Provides HTTP API to persist and retrieve key-value pairs from State while having pluggable state store. supports automatic client encryption of application state with support for key rotations. As part of state management, it enables developers to use the outbox pattern for achieving a single transaction across a transactional state store and any message broker. Refer <a href=https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/howto-outbox/
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>here</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="jobs">Jobs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#jobs">#</a></h3>
<p>jobs API is an orchestrator for scheduling these future jobs, either at a specific time or for a specific interval.</p>
<p>Typical use cases,</p>
<ul>
<li>Batch processing - Long running processing of large number of transactions. reports generation etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="demo">Demo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#demo">#</a></h2>
<p>For the purpose of the Demo, Lets have hypothetical use case for a Tenant Management System with below services,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tenant Service - Responsible for managing lifecycle of Tenant starting with onboarding. It receives request for new tenant, validates it and invokes notification to intimate tenant itself via e-mail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notification Service - This services exposes interface to receive requests from notification and then pushes it to pub/sub queue for processing by specific services meant for sending e-mail, SMS and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is depiction of the flow,</p>
<pre><code><figure>

<p>Lets do some load testing to assess impact of sidecar pattern of dapr vis-a-vis direct invocation. We will use <a href=https://k6.io/
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>k6</a> to perform  load testing. Note that, below test was conducted on my development laptop with no specific optimizations and modalities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Load testing criteria is setup as below,</p>
<figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="/images/dapr/loadtest-criteria.png"
             alt="Load test criteria"/> 
    </figure>

</li>
<li>
<p>Below are the results,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With dapr</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP
http_req_duration&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..: avg=6.51ms min=510µs med=2.11ms max=1.83s p(90)=3.7ms p(95)=4.89ms
{ expected_response:true }&hellip;: avg=6.52ms min=510µs med=2.11ms max=1.83s p(90)=3.7ms p(95)=4.89ms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without dapr</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP
http_req_duration&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..: avg=9.39ms min=308.09µs med=3.9ms max=2.94s p(90)=8.63ms p(95)=16.3ms
{ expected_response:true }&hellip;: avg=9.4ms  min=308.09µs med=3.9ms max=2.94s p(90)=8.63ms p(95)=16.31ms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that dapr results in better throughput than direct. This will have to dealt in detail on why this happens as generally direct communication will not have any overhead associated with sidecar. Let me know your thoughts in comments.</p>
<h3 id="gen-ai">Gen AI<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#gen-ai">#</a></h3>
<p>Dapr is keeping pace with tech. landscape changes and When it comes to Generative AI use cases and its implementation, it has a  building block named <a href=https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents
    
    target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>Dapr Agents</a> for it. In this, all the building blocks are extended to serve agentic Workload aimed at data crunching, inferencing  with Large Language Models (LLM) and operate them at scale.</p>
<p>It excels at below aspects compared to other Agentic frameworks,
- Guardrails - Obfuscation of Sensitive data while interacting with LLMs
- Authentication over MCP (Built-in identity using SPIFEE)
- mTLS for securing communication between Agents.
- Durable workflows
- Event driven ingestion</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#summary">#</a></h2>
<p>Dapr helps with</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardized vendor-neutral approach, eliminating concerns about lock-in, intellectual property risks, or proprietary restrictions.</li>
<li>Organizations gain full flexibility and control over their Distributed/microservices based applications.</li>
<li>Dapr works both for greenfield projects (built from scratch) and brownfield applications (existing applications being modernized or migrated).</li>
<li>A common scenario is migrating a monolithic or traditional service-based app to Kubernetes or another cloud-native infrastructure: Dapr can be introduced to handle inter-service communication, messaging, state, secrets — without rewriting the whole application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Coding !!</p>
