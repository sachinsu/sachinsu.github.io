This is followed by evaluating suitable data store. Likely evaluation criteria is Application&amp;rsquo;s Requirement (Tolerance for eventual consistency, High Availability etc.), Team&amp;rsquo;s familiarity, Costs, Tech. support availability and so on. In case of choices in relational databases, typical go to options are MySQL, PostgreSQL or even proprietary databases like Oracle , SQL Server.</description></item><item><title>Profiling and benchmarking tools for Applications</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/profiling_n_benchmarking/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 01:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/profiling_n_benchmarking/</guid><description>Introduction We develop a piece of software with aim to fulfil specific business requirements in terms of resource usage, throughput, availability among others. Profiling and benchmarking are approaches that developer has in his/her arsenal to gain continuous feedback on whether a piece of code is behaving optimally and adhering to it&amp;rsquo;s objectives.
Lets look at what they mean,
Profiling is defined as process aimed at understanding the behavior of a program.</description></item><item><title>Database Reliability Engineering - My Notes</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/dbre/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 01:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/dbre/</guid><description>Introduction I have been reading excellent Database Reliability Engineering book and below are my notes from it.
Key Incentive(s) for Automation
Elimination of Toil - Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows. Important System Characteristics
Latency, also known as response time, is a time-based measurement indicating how long it takes to receive a response from a request.</description></item><item><title>Near real time API Monitoring with Grafana and PostgreSQL</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/nrtanalysispostgresql/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 10:25:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/nrtanalysispostgresql/</guid><description>Introduction Suppose you have a distributed application running in production and it is based on Micro services/Service Oriented Architecture and have SLA of being &amp;ldquo;always on&amp;rdquo; (be available 24*7, barring deployments of course !!). In such cases, having proper monitoring of Application health in place is absolutely essential.
What if Monitoring is an afterthought (i.e. application is already in production) ? and that there is little apetite for additional components like (Visualization tools, specialized storage for logs/metrics/traces) for monitoring?</description></item><item><title>Upgrading API: Learnings</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/apiupgrade/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 01:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/apiupgrade/</guid><description>Introduction One of the design considerations stressed upon by Jeffrey richter about APIs (Read more here) is that &amp;ldquo;API is expected to be stable over long period of time&amp;rdquo;. Recently,for a .NET based project, we decided to upgrade some of the ASMX (legacy SOAP based approach) based APIs and were immediately reminded by Customer(s) to avoid any kind of impact on existing users.
This means that upgrade must be done keeping in mind,</description></item><item><title>Presto - A distributed SQL Engine for variety of data stores</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/presto/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2021 10:25:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/presto/</guid><description>Introduction In a company/enterprise, typically there are multiple sources of data. This could be result of M&amp;amp;A (where each of those add in a new data store) or result of multi year process of using data stores that are in vogue at that time. Result is combination of various types of relational databases, flat file systems, queues and so on. This results in Data Silos. This scenario is typically observed in companies who are running workloads On-prem (i.</description></item><item><title>ELT approach for Data Pipelines</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/elt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/elt/</guid><description>Introduction While gathering data for Analytics, one often has to source data from multiple sources. Traditionally, the approach has been to do ETL (Extract-Transform-load) where,
Extract - typically involves retrieving data from source. This could also be via streaming Transform - Apply transformation to the extracted data. Load - Loading the data in Operation Data store (ODS) or data warehouse Refer here for more details on ETL. ETL has been made easy by tools like Talend, SSIS and so on.</description></item><item><title>Learnings from Jeff Richter's Designing and Versioning HTTP REST APIs Video Course</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/restapiversioning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/restapiversioning/</guid><description>Background Recently, i went through excellent video series on Designing &amp;amp; Versioning HTTP_REST APIs presented by Jeffrey Richter. It is available here. In the past, i had read Jeff&amp;rsquo;s books on CLR and found his writing to be very clear and understandable. So is my experience with this Video Series.

It then goes through Continuous integration, automated testing, provisioning and deployment. Given High availability requirements expected (or should i say assumed) nowadays, As much as functional correctness of the Unit, it is also important to test how a Unit/Component handles failures, delays etc. in distributed environment. Often, such behavior is observed in production itself, unless project team is following practices of Chaos engineering.</description></item><item><title>Using Temporal.io to build Long running Workflows</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/temporalworkflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 08:25:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/temporalworkflow/</guid><description>Background In a typical business Application, there are often requirements for,
Batch processing - Often long running Tasks like data import/export, End of day processing etc. These tasks are often scheduled to be executed at pre-defined interval or on occurance of an Event. Asychronous processing - Tasks, often part of business process / workflow, that can be performed asychronously or offloaded. Such requirements are often fulfilled with custom approaches like batch processing frameworks, ETL Tools or using Queues or specific database features.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with OpenTelemetry</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/opentelemetry/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 08:25:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/opentelemetry/</guid><description>Background How many times have we landed up in a meeting staring at random slowness or such production issues in a distributed Application ? only to experience helplessness with limited (or often times no) visibility available about the runtime behavior of the Application. It often ends up in manually correlating whatever diagnostic data available from Application and combining it with trace/logs that are available from O/S, databases etc. and trying to figure out &amp;ldquo;Root cause&amp;rdquo; of the issue.</description></item><item><title>Ninja - Using lightweight build system for Go projects</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/ninjabuildsystem/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 10:25:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/ninjabuildsystem/</guid><description>Background I primarily work on Windows for development purposes. Whenever its about writing code in Golang, invariably one comes across usage of Make. A quick check on popular Go projects on Github will show Makefile being used to automate tasks like linting, build, testing and deployment.
Being on Windows, i have been looking for alternative build tool that is easy to setup (i.e. doesn&amp;rsquo;t require mingw and such environments) and use compared to Make (which is primarily targetted at Unix and Unix like Operating Systems).</description></item><item><title>Validating urls from 'Useful Links' section using bash / command line tools</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/urlhealthchecks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 10:25:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/urlhealthchecks/</guid><description>Background I started this blog, https://sachinsu.github.io few months back .
In this relatively short period of time, Blog has sizeable number of useful links across various categories in addition to the detailed blog post like this one.
As an ongoing activity, I think that it is necessary to verify links mentioned on this blog.
So how can it be done ? obviously one way is to do it manually by visiting each link and updating/removing those that are no longer available.</description></item><item><title>Trobleshooting TCP Connection request time outs</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/connectiontimeouts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 10:25:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/connectiontimeouts/</guid><description>Background I recently had opportunity to support team who has been battling with Intermittent (scary i know :)) issues with TCP connectivity in Production.

The Web development has been revolving around HTML+CSS+Javascript trio. It all started with support for Javascript in browsers, followed by addition of XMLHTTP API, Rich DOM Manipulation Support in Javascript. To induce order and apply patterns to Javascript&amp;rsquo;s usage in browsers, numerous frameworks and libraries were introduced like React and Vue among others.</description></item><item><title>Using Github Actions for Automated Testing and Deployment</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/usinggithubactions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 10:25:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/usinggithubactions/</guid><description>Background The source code of tracfee.com is hosted on Github Private.
At a High level, Tracfee&amp;rsquo;s Architecture involves,
Single Page Application using VueJS, deployed on Netlify API in Go, deployed on Oracle Cloud So far, API testing has been automated and we were looking at ways to automate deployment of both UI and API.

Using DDD is most beneficial when the complexity of the domain makes it challenging for the domain experts to communicate their needs to the software developers. By investing your time and effort into modeling the domain and coming up with a set of terminology that&amp;rsquo;s understood for each subdomain, the process of understanding and solving the problem becomes much simpler and smoother</description></item></channel></rss>
