For point 2 from above, some of the tasks identified were,\nSending Email/SMS on myriad of events Integration with External Applications over HTTP Next task was to arrive at approach on how to perform them effectively outside of hot code path without incurring need of any additional resources (hardware or software)as far as possible. Accordingly, we had two options,\nPolling - Periodically polling database to check for occurance of event and then performing the action. Event Driven - Using Event notification feature of database (e.g. Listen/Notify in PostgreSQL or Change Notification/Advanced Queuing in Oracle). We decided to go with Event driven as,\nCleaner approach that doesn’t require perodically checking for events thus consuming a database connection and more code. We may have to have more than one such daemons to cater to different events in application. Post finalizing on event driven approach for gathering events, next task was to determine how to effectively send email/sms or any other HTTP requests considering that rate of arrival of events will not be matching rate of processing them. Also these\nSo what are the options available in .NET Ecosystem, Below are the ones i am aware of,\nChannels - High performance implementation of In-memory producer/consumer pattern. TPL Dataflow - Super set of Channels Library. Aimed at use cases where blocks of logic are to be linked together to same or different consumers and so on. Also all these features come with additional overheads. For the task at hand, functionality offered by Channels is sufficient to implement in-memory producer consumer pattern.\nSo we wrapped above event processing in a Windows service implemented as .NET Core Worker Service\nGeneric Implementation is as follows,\nEvent Generator - In practice, this class will be responsible for wiring up to receive events from database\nEvent Consumer which uses channels to process events in parallel\nRefer Gist here\nAdditionally, one may want to process requests out of order or asynchronously without using message queues. One such use case could be service to send Notifications where this service is exposed as Web API and it uses external service to dispatch notifications. For such scenarios, one can use back ground job in conjunction with Channels to process requests.\nBelow code shows a Web API that handles HTTP Requests and delegates actual task to background worker which is deployed as hosted service.\nRefer Gist here\nHowever, note that there are trade-offs vis-a-vis message queues with this approach. Notably, in case of Web server crash, the pending jobs in queue will be lost.\nSummary Other languages (notably Channels in Go) have been providing out of the box implementation for in-memory producer with concurrent, parallel consumers.
