&lt;p>We develop a piece of software with aim to fulfil specific business requirements in terms of resource usage, throughput, availability among others. Profiling and benchmarking are approaches that developer has in his/her arsenal to gain continuous feedback on whether a piece of code is behaving optimally and adhering to it&amp;rsquo;s objectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at what they mean,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Profiling is defined as process &lt;code>aimed at understanding the behavior of a program. A profile result might be a table of time taken per function,&lt;/code> as per &lt;a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34801622/difference-between-benchmarking-and-profiling

>this&lt;/a> and &lt;a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_%28computer_programming%29

>this&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Benchmarking &lt;code>measures the time for some whole operation. e.g. I/O operations per second under some workload. So the result is typically a single number, in either seconds or operations per second. Or a data set with results for different parameters, so you can graph it.&lt;/code>.

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Typically, Profiling is supported by most of the environments (either via IDEs like &lt;a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/profiling-feature-tour?view&amp;#61;vs-2022
 
 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>Visual Studio&lt;/a> or through language itself [Like &lt;a href=https://go.dev/blog/pprof
 
 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>Go&lt;/a>] has buil-in provision for the same while Benchmarking is typically performed on dedicated testing infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
