&lt;p&gt;A Client has E-commerce Application consisting of services aimed at specific domains of business functionality it serves. One of these services is responsible for accepting the order, authenticating it and forwarding it for further processing in terms of inventory checks, payment and so on. For Authentication, this service sends &lt;a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS
 
 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; to Customer&amp;rsquo;s Mobile number (and e-mail id) and customer is supposed to confirm this order placement by means of entering Code received in it. This code is valid for a short duration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Upgrading API: Learnings</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/apiupgrade/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 01:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/apiupgrade/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is that &amp;ldquo;API is expected to be stable over long period of time&amp;rdquo;. Recently,for a .NET based project, we decided to upgrade some of the ASMX (legacy SOAP based approach) based APIs and were immediately reminded by Customer(s) to avoid any kind of impact on existing users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that upgrade must be done keeping in mind,&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Learnings from Jeff Richter's Designing and Versioning HTTP REST APIs Video Course</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/restapiversioning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/restapiversioning/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
