In such cases, having proper monitoring of Application health in place is absolutely essential.
What if Monitoring is an afterthought (i.e. application is already in production) ? and that there is little apetite for additional components like (Visualization tools, specialized storage for logs/metrics/traces) for monitoring?</description></item><item><title>ELT approach for Data Pipelines</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/elt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/elt/</guid><description>Introduction While gathering data for Analytics, one often has to source data from multiple sources. Traditionally, the approach has been to do ETL (Extract-Transform-load) where,
Extract - typically involves retrieving data from source. This could also be via streaming Transform - Apply transformation to the extracted data. Load - Loading the data in Operation Data store (ODS) or data warehouse Refer here for more details on ETL. ETL has been made easy by tools like Talend, SSIS and so on.</description></item><item><title>Resiliency Testing with Toxiproxy</title><link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/resiliencytoxiproxy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 10:25:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/resiliencytoxiproxy/</guid><description>Background In a typical workflow of software development, Developer implements a Unit/component, tests it and pushes the changes to source control repository. It then goes through Continuous integration, automated testing, provisioning and deployment. Given High availability requirements expected (or should i say assumed) nowadays, As much as functional correctness of the Unit, it is also important to test how a Unit/Component handles failures, delays etc. in distributed environment. Often, such behavior is observed in production itself, unless project team is following practices of Chaos engineering.</description></item></channel></rss>
