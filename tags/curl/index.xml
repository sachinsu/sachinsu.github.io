&lt;p>I started this blog, &lt;a href=https://sachinsu.github.io
 
 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"
>https://sachinsu.github.io&lt;/a> few months back .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this relatively short period of time, Blog has sizeable number of useful links across various categories in addition to the detailed blog post like this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an ongoing activity, I think that it is necessary to verify links mentioned on this blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how can it be done ? obviously one way is to do it manually by visiting each link and updating/removing those that are no longer available. but there is always of better way of doing things.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
