Batch processing - Often long running Tasks like data import/export, End of day processing etc. These tasks are often scheduled to be executed at pre-defined interval or on occurance of an Event. Asychronous processing - Tasks, often part of business process / workflow, that can be performed asychronously or offloaded. Such requirements are often fulfilled with custom approaches like batch processing frameworks, ETL Tools or using Queues or specific database features.</description></item></channel></rss>
