      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every developer is a developer or consumer of distributed systems, as mentioned by Brendan Burns &lt;a href=https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-CNTNT-eBook-DesigningDistributedSystems.pdf

&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Distributed systems have it&amp;rsquo;s pros but also introduces challenges due to distribution of objects. Popular approaches like, Microservices,  promotes  services that represent a business capability and are independently deployed. This increases modularity, scalability but there are always trade-offs involved like,
- &lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt; - They are harder to develop and operate. Programming models are often optimized for in-process communication in terms of development and testing. However, Services, in a distributed application, involve remote/out of process calls (e.g. https/gRPC). This makes it difficult to program, debug/test and operate them.
- &lt;strong&gt;Eventual Consistency&lt;/strong&gt; - Microservices introduce eventual consistency  because of their laudable insistence on decentralized data management. One is most likely to face issue of &amp;ldquo;Dual writes&amp;rdquo; (The dual-write problem occurs when two external systems must be updated in an atomic fashion) in distributed application.
- &lt;strong&gt;Operability&lt;/strong&gt; - Managing multiple independent services have its pros but induce complexity when it comes to frequent deployments and monitoring. As aptly put by Martin fowler &lt;a href=https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html#distribution

&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Low bar for skill is higher in a microservice environment&amp;rdquo;.
- &lt;strong&gt;Deployment&lt;/strong&gt; - Cloud brings in another dimension where companies want to leverage them for their benefits but want to be agnostic or avoid lock-in to a particular vendor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
