      <title>Troubleshooting TLS handshake issue</title>
      <link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/tlshandsharefailure/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever encountered a scenario where REST API consumption works from tools like &lt;a href=https://github.com/jeroen/curl
    
    target=_blank rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;
&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;, Web Browser but not from Application. Lets dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirement is as simple as consuming REST API from a Application over TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-statement&#34;&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The REST API, to be consumed, is standard API interface which requires access over TLS. The client in this case is Windows 2016 server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Development, Windows 10 is used to develop and test the code. Later, the same is tested on a Windows 2016 Server. It is at this stage, it fails with cryptic Error &amp;ldquo;The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel&amp;rdquo;. But it works fine with other tools like curl, PostMan or even from a Web Browser.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A Client has E-commerce Application consisting of services aimed at specific domains of business functionality it serves. One of these services is responsible for accepting the order, authenticating it and forwarding it for further processing in terms of inventory checks, payment and so on. For  Authentication, this service sends &lt;a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS
    
    target=_blank rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;
&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; to Customer&amp;rsquo;s  Mobile number (and e-mail id) and customer is supposed to confirm this order placement by means of entering Code received in it. This code is valid for a short duration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Upgrading API: Learnings</title>
      <link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/apiupgrade/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the design considerations stressed upon by Jeffrey richter about APIs (Read more &lt;a href=https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/restapiversioning/
    
    
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is that &amp;ldquo;API is expected to be stable over long period of time&amp;rdquo;. Recently,for a .NET based project, we decided to upgrade some of the ASMX (legacy SOAP based approach) based APIs and were immediately reminded by Customer(s) to avoid any kind of impact on existing users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that upgrade must be done keeping in mind,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trobleshooting TCP Connection request time outs</title>
      <link>https://sachinsu.github.io/posts/connectiontimeouts/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had opportunity to support team who has been battling with Intermittent (scary i know :)) issues with TCP connectivity in Production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplified deployment Architecture is as below,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://sachinsu.github.io/images/conntimeoutarch.png&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            High Level Architecture
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology Stack used is Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 using ODP.NET for Oracle Connectivity (Oracle Server is 8 CPU box). Each of Web Servers in cluster have IIS hosted on it with multiple Applications (Application domains) serving HTTP(s) based traffic. These applications connect to Oracle Database.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
